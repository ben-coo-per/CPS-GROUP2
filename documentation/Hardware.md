The hardware for this project includes a 12V DC motor run through an L298N motor driver.
The same 12V power supply is used to power the motor as well as the motor driver and the LED lights, after it has been run through a 12V to 5V voltage step down converter.

In addition to the hardware that is run through the arduino, we have connected a microphone, camera, and printer to our python script that we use to record a story, capture an image of the object, and print out a generated ticket, respectively.
