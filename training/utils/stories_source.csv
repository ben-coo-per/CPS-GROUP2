Primary Recordings,"I basically carry around a little tube of perfume. Um, the reason being that I have always travelled a lot on my own since I was like 16 or something. I, I, I left and I travel around Europe and then I travel around the world. And, I've just done that a lot through my life, but I'm super close to my family. In particular, my sister, uh, and what I used to do when I, this is my partner thinks this is a bit sad, but cause I still do it, but I used to, um, when I went in through an airport, um, I would go and spray my sister' s perfume on me. Cause I think scent is such a strong, um, you know, evoking, uh, sense. So, anyway, I still carry around, I carry around this little bit of perfume. That' s her perfume. that she gave me, it was like, um, she bought the perfume, they get little free ones. She, doesn't live in the country. That's why I never really see her."
Primary Recordings,"And this was for, I went to an event and a friend of a friend ran around Iceland and so this was a raffle ticket to buy a bottle of whiskey for that event to help raise money."
Primary Recordings,"I've got a necklace with two little charm things on it. And both were given to me by my mum. This is St. Christopher.So this was inherited from my grandad. And he' s the patron saint of travelling. So it' s supposed to protect me as I gothrough the world. And this is a little clover, which my mum was given for being, like, lead girl guide in the country whenshe was, like, 18. And, yeah, she gave it to me. And I think it' s got a little engraving on the back, but I can' t actuallyremember. Is it just the hallmark? Yeah, Queen' s Guide Award. In 72. Yeah, the date is...? Yeah. Yes."
Primary Recordings,"If I need to choose one, I'd probably choose my ring, because it' s from my granddad. And then I got my initials engraved into it when he passed away, when I got it from him."
Primary Recordings,"Okay, so this is a necklace that I got for my other grandparents when they were married for 50 years and then me and mysisters all got one with our first initial engraved and then the little heart is when my mum turned 50 and she gave that to all of us as well."
Primary Recordings,"I am overly nostalgic, so much so that I don' t really like this bracelet at all, because my mum gave it to me and I wear it every day. A heart' s not really my thing, and also it used to be gold, but now it' s silver. So even though it's worn and tarnished, I will keep it on every time I get down to the building."
Primary Recordings,"My earrings are covers from the late 14th century, gold, and brown dyes attached to the hoops. These are titled, from thegrad course, Design, Innovation, and Great Engineering. The abbreviation of which is DICE. And so, everything we had was DICE themed. And then I found these in my third year, and I would wear them when I used to do open dates with DICE and stuff. And my aunt used to say, look she loves DICE so much, she even has the earrings.' So I really liked it."
Primary Recordings,"So I had this shirt and I bought it when I was maybe 19 from a thrift shop and on the back of it, it said, no justice, just us.And it was, yeah, pretty cringe, but it was a cool design and kind of rocked around with it for a while and saw a lot of things, that shirt. And then one day I' m going to the pub in Sydney and this huge bouncer, Maori guy, I think, I was 19,he goes, where'd you get that shirt? I was like, taken aback. I was like, what do you mean? He goes, where'd you get that shirt? And I was like, oh, thrift shop. He's like, oh, let me in. And I look on it, what the shirt means later, it's the Hell' s Angels shirt. Big Biker Gang shirt. Anyway, I still got this shirt to this day. I still rock it. So it's funny. Yeah. Okay."
Primary Recordings,"Yeah, so it's a clip from American Football Pads and it's off the first set of pads I had playing American Football at university. It was banged up, I had to get it replaced, but I keep it on my keychain because it's now a sport I play a lot. It's something I think about, like starting playing the sport and it's just something to carry with because it's reflective of getting into the sport as a whole and the time and effort I've put into it as well."
Primary Recordings,"Okay, okay, okay! I really like this ring; I bought it in Brighton from like a jeweler/artisan. The reason why I like this ring is because... so there's this boy band that I really like and they' ve been doing a bunch of tours but they' ve never performed in London, and then there was a show coming up it wasn't there, wasn' t there? They had announced a tourwith a certain amount of dates and locations, and there was like, ' Oh, we' re on that. We' ll announce the rest later.' And I was like, ' Oh, they're gonna announce European dates then...' l’ll go to the concert it would be fun they never announced European dates so the tour just ended up happening without them coming to Europe and then a festival was happening in London and they were on the set list for that festival so I was like okay I' ll just treat that as if it was the concert so and for this concert I wanted to like where like a themed outfit like that matched the theme of like the album that had just come out so when I was in Brighton I saw this ring I thought it really matched the concept very well because it was like a Peter Pan Neverland type of concept and I thought this looked like very fairytale -ish so I was like oh it' s cute, it will match like the theme then I got tickets for the concert, I was super excited, then the concert got cancelled, it was not great like the organization was really bad, it all got cancelled so they never came. So I' m really in the hopes that one day I' ll be able to wear it to a concert so yeah, basically that' s why I wear it."
Primary Recordings,I’m wearing these beige trousers linen that i made myself and my mom taught me how to make it because she is a fashion designer actually and then they turn out a bit baggier than they were but it' s the first one that i made myself so they mean a lot to me i made them last year um they' ve whitened a little bit in the meantime which makes me sad because they were a nicer colour before but yeah i really like them um yeah i' m gonna what do they mean to me they don't they mean a lot to me it' s the first trousers that i ever made and i' m going home this weekend i' m gonna make two more.
Primary Recordings,"So this is called Kadiyam in Telugu and it is called bracelet in general language. This is made of copper and it can be made of silver and gold as well, depending upon how rich you are. So the significance of this item is that it is actually worn as to safeguard oneself from evil forces in the nature. So that is the primary reason people wear it; Punjabi culture they wear it because Punjabis are naturally, they were a warrior race. They used to fight a lot of battles and they used to wear this as a symbol of their victory. Every time they won this thing, they used to imprint something that symbolizes their victory and they used to wear this. Not the number of this, the same thing, they used to imprint a symbol on the surface of this thing."
Primary Recordings,"So something that one of my friends gave me when I left New Zealand was this little keychain which is made out of the clay from the beach that I grew up next to. So they went to that beach and collected a bunch of clay, processed it, somesand as well, and turned it into a little fired clay keyring thing, which I can kind of take a little piece of New Zealand with me to the UK."
Primary Recordings,"So it has like it's a kind of a memorial object. And then I went to free diving in Tonga, Tonga kingdom, they have like a bunch of native people who make this kind of accessories and necklace out of the whale' s bone, so it' s kind of really interesting how this could be connected to the end life of a whale, this is how they memorialize the whale and also respect the whale, and that's why also I saw that the well there, so it Also connected to the memory that I got so, it's kind of meaningful object to me."
Primary Recordings,"My ring on my pinky is from the order of the engineers. When I graduated from university, the engineering class was all inducted into the order, and you take an oath to never cause harm with anything you design. The ring is worn on the pinky of your dominant hand so that when you're writing, or doing calculations, the ring rubs against the paper and reminds you of your duty."
Primary Recordings,"So I was underneath a park once, um, there was these old World War II tunnels in my hometown and um, they had been bricked up since like the 30s, 40s, um. Anyway, we found a cave so we could figure out a way to get into it; they're bricked up with 8 . 8 million blocks of clay. So we managed to crawl in and um, haul out I mean we're in there for ages but we managed to then haul out this massive, massive chunk of clay and we like crawled out really in a like quite a tough I know crawl space with this like massive brick um, and yeah, now I don' I know what to do with it, so it's hidden in the corner of my old university and I hope no one finds it; so maybe someday we can put it in a museum. Or, I get my clay, and I want to make some stuff out of that clay."
Primary Recordings,"Um, yeah, the bracelet that I'm wearing, like its origin story, I guess, like my mom is super into like astrologers and things like that and the astrologer said I should be wearing a black permaline bracelet at all times and there's not a lot of things that my mom asked of me so when she was like ' hey, could you please wear this?' I said sure, yeah, so that's really the whole story behind it apparently it' s for like protection."
Primary Recordings,"I've never bought fancy stuff. So, then I went for this wholesale fashion. And I picked up a fancy bag from Coach. And it's like this green, bottle green bag, which is really pretty. And it gets a lot of compliments, which I'm never used to. Because I usually don't give a shit about what I'm carrying. So, it's just a bit part of my identity. And I think I really like bottle green as an accent color now. So, I try to put in a green wherever I can in my routine."
Primary Recordings,"I'll show you what I have. Whoa, in fact, actually, this is almost 10 years old now. I carry with me, it' s pretty sucked at the moment, I carry with me this. It's a business card of a Burmese monk that he gave to me on my Christmas holiday 10 years ago. And I carry that with me for good luck. I love it. Wait, tell me more about how, like, where did you get it? I was on a family holiday in Myanmar just after it opened up. And, of course, you can't visit now anymore either.It' s at war. And I met this gentleman on the airplane. We were on a little regional flight from one place in the country to another. And I was seated next to this monk. And we spoke for a bit. And he said, you know, if you ever need advice, you can contact me. And he gave me his business card. You know, he might not even be alive anymore. 10 years ago, he was a very old gentleman. Yeah, so I am sentimental about this. And I carry that with me everywhere. It’s in my wallet."
Reddit Thread,"My mother's father worked for QANTAS (airline) for decades. Anyway, one day, decades ago, he notices the Beatles boarding a plane. He runs up and begs for an autograph and John Lennon whinges and bitches about it and Paul McCartney says something like, ""John, relax"" and they agree. So my grandfather gets them to sign one piece of paper for my uncle and another one for my mum, but John Lennon's pen keeps failing and he refuses to sign the second paper after the failed attempt. Paul McCartney hands him his pen and says something that equates to ""John, don't be a dick"" (it's been years since I've heard the story) and John signs it again. Ta-Da! Beatles autographs! I feel like such a name dropper."

Reddit Thread,"My parents had a flood in their basement which... incidentally destroyed all my childhood photos age 7 to 21. But when I went through the boxes, I found this photograph of my grandpa who was British army during WW2 but passed away in 2001. It's a Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife.

Reddit Thread,"My dad owns a Gibson F-4 I think mandolin made somewhere between 1906 and 1916 I can't remember where it is in there, it took a lot of research to find the date when we did. It was purchased by my Grandpa in the 50's for the steep price of 50 dollars to fool around on. It has a turtle shell pick guard as well as beautiful inlay on almost every piece of the instrument including the tuning keys. The value since then has increased immensely, but I don't think my dad or I will ever sell it. Besides the emotional attachment due to my grandfather buying it this is also a piece of history. It is one of the first instruments made by my favorite company, the people who crafted this mandolin almost 100 years ago paved the way for many of the great guitars of today which I have the honor of playing and owning. Pretty damn fascinating to me."

This is a bow from a tribe way up the Tambo River, given to him by the eldest after saving his son from a severe anemia."
Reddit Thread,"These are bits of Hadrian's wall, the Parthenon and the Colosseum that an uncle collected in the 70s. This is a bit of the Berlin Wall, and supposedly a bit of the Great Wall of China. They're all fairly small, about golf-ball size, and look just like bits of debris, except for the piece of the Berlin wall which has a bit of paint on it. They pretty much look like uninteresting rocks on a shelf until you realize what they are."

Reddit Thread,A necklace from my husband. It’s a beautiful Tahitian pearl with a tiny diamond on top. Simple and not very pricey but it’s so beautiful and I love it - probably because he picked it all by himself and I am allergic to my wedding ring so I can’t wear that.
Reddit Thread,"A bandana I bought at a thrift store. I know how it sounds, but I have a hard time keeping any material item for longer than a few years. I found that bandana around 14 and wore it on a variety of ways pretty often my ex wore it a lot. I am married now and my daughter wears it. I wore it a lot pregnant. I also wore it through labor and delivery. It's a good bandana that has been through a lot with me."
Reddit Thread,My late Grandmother always use to call me her 'Rose'. Before she passed away she gave me a small ceramic rose that can either be used on a necklace or bracelet. It had a few broken edges and the colour was faded. That was 15 years ago and I still keep that rose in my jewelry box.
Reddit Thread,"My late Grandfather didn't like watching t.v, he would literally only watch the news at 19h00 every night and then go back to his table outside and play Boggle (word game). He would sit for hours and just play by himself, seeing how many words he can find. I had an option to choose one of his Boggle sets when he passed away. I took his oldest, most used one. The letters are so faded you can hardly see them, but that doesn't make any difference to hoe important it is. It now has a prime spot in my display case at home."

Reddit Thread,"When I was 7 or 8, my parents finished renovating my room and I received a new bed set. I have been using that same blanket for the past 14 years and had it worn down, just right. It meant a lot to me (I couldn’t tell you why), but when I had come home to find my puppy had torn it to shreds some time throughout the day, I was devastated. They just don't make blankets like that anymore."
Reddit Thread,"I have this stuffed tigger that i absolutely adore. He fits perfectly in my hand and i hold him every night. If he’s not in my hand, i have a hard time falling asleep. I’ve had him since I was 4 months old & im 20 now so he’s been through it all. That’s why i will never get rid of him. He’s come with me on most trips/vacations/camps, even to school and honestly I’ve probably taken him with me to the grocery store. He’s lost all of stripes, his color has faded a little and his head flops down now but that’s what gives him personality!"
Reddit Thread,"When I got into photography in my teens, my dad gave me his old SLR from the 70s. Heavy as hell and cumbersome, but I took all my photos with it. My parents don't have much to pass down to me, so I cherish it even if I don't use it as much anymore."
Reddit Thread,I have a blouse from 1910 that is from France. It fits me and the amazing thing is that you can tell it was handmade for a particular person because of how it fits.

But it just brings up so much fond memories of having been cared about."

My maternal grandmother gave it to me when I was about 7, telling me she had been given it at the same age from an old lady who had the thing when SHE was herself a child.

Every morning I see this drawing hanging on West wall of my room and I ask myself why I still have this symbol of mockery. For the purpose of remembering what it felt to be alive, and to serve as a motive to keep existing in this gloomy world. Short lived moments that live on to inspire me."

Reddit Thread,"My class ring from highschool. To me I have had it since I was 16 years old, several GFs have worn it and still have chips in it from when they threw it at me. This thing has seen me go from being asocial to a social butterfly and has seen me travel. Besides when the gf had worn it I've always had it on me."
Reddit Thread,"A young mother with her 3 kids walked by and into the bank right near me. She was so damn stressed out as her oldest child (about 10) was holding a soccer ball and kept running out of the bank forcing her to run off after him. Eventually the ball rolled towards me and i just starting mucking around and playing keep-away with him. I nodded at the lady in a sort of ""I'll wait here with him for you"" kinda way. She was a local and had spoken to me a few times before so she knew I wasn't going anywhere. After about half an hour of mucking around she came out and he took off this little white stringy bracelet thing he was wearing (he was Kenyan and had a shit load all up his arm) and gave it to me and said thanks for playing with him. 5 years later it's still on my wrist. It wasn't even that crazy of an interaction but the kid just stuck a chord with me."
Reddit Thread,"Mine is a small, brown stuffed rabbit named Berry. He smelled like raspberries when I took him out of the box. My Dad gave him to me when I was 7 and I slept with him by my side until about 3 years ago. My Dad used to travel a lot and he would be out of town for weeks at a time. I latched onto this rabbit as a symbol of my Dad's love for me. I was a pretty lonely kid. I had a ton of imaginary friends (I knew they were imaginary) and I pretended to be king of the toys. But Berry was always my favorite because he reminded me of my Dad when he wasn't physically around. Don't worry, no sob story, my Dad is alive/healthy and still very much a part of my life. But I think Berry got me through a tough portion of my life."
Reddit Thread,"I have this skateboarding dvd of me and my friends when we were 14. 24 now and it's great to watch it every now and again. It's about 20 minutes long, the skateboarding isn't bad considering we were 14 and has a bunch of footage of us just generally pissing around. Think it's the only copy left to so id be so pissed if it was damaged."

Reddit Thread,"There's also this thing he flicked at my head one night that I started wearing as a bracelet. It's just three little bands from one of potholder loom making kits tied together. It is ragged and ratty and discoloured from years of wear but it hasn't broken yet and will stay on my wrist until all three strands are too broken to tie back together. Hell, even one it gets to that point I'll probably just braid it into a something else to take its place."
Reddit Thread,"I wear my Grandpa's service tags 24/7. I haven't taken them off since his funeral. I worry all the time that they'll be broken. I worry even more that someone will take them off if I land myself in the ER or something but not having his dog tags won't change anything. I still have the memories, and I guess the greatest loss for me would be forgetting all of that. Even if I'm not aware of the loss I have undergone. I'm sorry that I'm long winded, but I guess this was kind of cathartic. If you're curious about the service tags, my grandpa was in the Army. I lives with him from 4 to 17 years old. He passed away a few weeks before I turned 20. When I was 16, I wanted to wear the tags to school because we were talking about WWII in history (I thought my teacher would like seeing them). I asked him if he still had them, and he showed me them in his nightstand. I was kind of in awe, and I asked if I could wear them. My grandpa is not sentimental at all. He answered me by saying, ""You like them? You can keep them."" It was all very casual, but I wore them frequently up until his death. Travelling to his funeral, I wore them, but I took them off before the wake. I didn't put them back on until I returned to my hotel room after all the services were done, and I haven't taken them off since. I partially didn't wear them during the services because I didn't want one of my aunts to suddenly decide they wanted them and try to guilt me and intimidate me into giving them up. My aunts never did understand that I considered him my dad (my mom understood). I'd put up a picture, but they obviously have his identifying information on them. They're standard issue. I'm not sure if they're originals or not. They have the little indent toward the top left (when reading the tag), and on the back there is a rim. The lettering is stamped with two lines of writing. The top line is last name, first name. And the second line is his military ID (not SSN). I tested him once to see if he could remember his number because of something on NCIS (which my grandpa happened to love). The tags are in fairly good shape. There are a few dents and scratches. I wish now that I had asked for more stories about when he was in the military. Off the top of my head, the only story I can recall was when he was a private and the most disliked private was giving the duty of waking everyone up. Which just made everyone dislike him even more to the point people were constantly pulling pranks on him. Anyways, I should wrap this up... I just have a lot of fond memories of my grandpa because he was an amazing man."
Reddit Thread,"My boy scout merit badge sash is my most prized possession. it holds all of what i have earned and labored for over the years, each badge has it's own memories tied to it. i remember my first badge was first aid, i am also the most proud of it. that badge tells me ""hey, if you see someone hurt it is your DUTY to help them because you have the knowledge for broken bones, compound injuries and so much more."" i have since helped teach the merit badge to others in hope they never have to use the knowledge."

GQ Videoseries,hi I'm Maya Hawk and these are my 10  Essentials this is my guitar this is the first guitar that I bought for myself and I bought it with the cash that I made from a tour I did of Blue Notes in Japan basically the first tour I ever went on we played two shows a night for a week I think it was insane it was one of the best learning experiences I've ever had in my life I think when I firststarted playing shows I was really like doing this kind of drunk Disney princess personality on stage where I was like laughing and smiling a lot and like kind of making fun of myself and doing like a oh whoops like oh I don't know guys thank you so much for coming out and having to do it twice in one night I just learned to hate it it was a reallytransformative set of shows for me I then got on the plane flew back I went to LA and I had cash in my wallet from that trip and I went and bought this guitar somebody other than me carved the word Butch into the corner so that's her name her name is Butch this is a problem that came from crafty on set for the most part it's like when you're working a late night shoot it's just hard not to want to eat candy on stranger things they they carry these particular candies for me these are my favorite candies uh the now and laters and the smarties I really like sour candy but I don't know if anyone isfamiliar with this most sour candy like Sour Patch Kids sour watermelons sour ropes sour straws sour Sky these kinds of candies they have a delicious but uh tongue destroying sort of umami powder and if you like to eat a an appropriate amount of candy you can end up with likea bleeding this is disgusting what I'm saying but like a bleeding mouth or like a very sore mouth so the smarties and the now and ERS achieve the goal of sourness without injuring the mouth I have a large collection ofstriped shirts most of them are vintage but this is a perfect black and white striped shirt it is maybe the mostimportant
GQ Videoseries,to me clothing wise it's been that way for a long time in my life I'm committing I feel like that's athing of getting older is you start to like realize the things about yourself that like the phases you want to stay inand I feel like I'm committing to the striped shirt in my life it's a very happy marriage this is a bra it is a perfectbra when you're working in this industry you often have to go and put on clothes that are not your clothes and like if it's a photo shoot there's like a rack of clothes and you try them on and you're making work but people often forget to bring clothes that work for women with boobs or bras for women with boobs so I've learned that you must bring your own and I found that this is the perfect bra it is also unfortunately generally out of stock I got it from this underwear store that was in Woodstock New York I think I don't know 8 years ago that store is now closed this brand you can only buy them on likeresale like used this one I got fresh it's perfect it's supportive it gives you differentiation and shape it has no underwire but it doesn't make that kind of uni boob effect or the triangle effect that other bras have that have no underwire it's just a perfect bra I wasn't like a special blanket kid but I became a special blanket adult Ialways have a scarf it can double as a sleep mask and it can double as like a hood sometimes I will kind of just like have it drapey you can make it nighttime really easily if you need to take a nap you know it's really good to have on set where you can do emergency naps but thenI'll also do like a a whole Hood
GQ Videoseries,um you see I haven't done it in a while um no this is backwards have to startforward then go around pull up into kind of a little like hoodie guy and then you got your ears warmed too um and then you can kind of wrap it there I probably look silly I normally do it in a mirror as you can tell by the fact that I showed like a comfort scarf and a PJ set and a sleep mask I'm very bedtime oriented so this sleep mask changed my life and I'm now now a full addict it has these detachable eye cups I'll detach one just to sort of this is now a tutorial they make complete darknesswithout having actual pressure on your eyes which I really like and you know how sleep masks usually slip off at night this has a velcro strap that you can tighten you know I keep putting things on my head people are going to kill me but that you can tighten properly around the back so that it doesn't come off at night and now I'm like fully addicted to sleeping in this
GQ Videoseries,like if I don't have it I'll like tie something around my head I don't know there's something magical about having something tight wrapped around your head and your eyes that makes mejust go like okay it's  bedtime so really if I was going to bring like my whole skincare routine here it would be pretty useless to anyone because I realized that instead of like spending way too much money ontrying different products that were recommended to me to help with my acne I should just go see a dermatologist so I did so if I showed you my skincare routine it would be some pills and some medical creams all of which you couldn't buy without seeing a doctor but one
GQ Videoseries,that I try to always keep in my purse with me is just Vitamin E oil I buy it at Whole Foods it's like amazing for cuticles it's an amazing like kind of shiny lip gloss I put it on when I have like a acne scar that's healing it does have this kind of shininess effect so if you put it on you kind of get a little glimmer which is either a positive or A negative depending on your relationship to being shiny on that day and then this is a sun Suns screen concealer Foundation moisturizer like allinone it's like 50 SPF very important I try to wear sunscreen everyday and it also just like really evens out your skin tone my family isn't overly Beauty focused um but everything I know Ilearned from my mom Vitamin E oil these are a cure to my uh attention issues I love to watercolor I watercolorsince was a little kid I love this brand of watercolor it's beautiful comes in a beautiful case the colors are reallybright I personalized this miniature set my real set is like twice the size of this and then there's two layers andthen I bring a watercolor book in here mostly I do like weird imaginary color paintings while I'm just like doingother stuff to try to calm my brain this is the original version of um this card that I sent out to announce This Record chaos angel that I'm promoting right now now and here's the the real version and then I bring this with me which is just so many brushes oh and apparently aflosser which I also could have considered an sessionalitem I always try to carry a book with me in my bag mostly it is an aspirational goal I've done this since I was a kid like I used to go on trips and I would pack like 20 books in my bag I've now usually narrowed it down to one I wouldn't read any of them but I would like how it made me feel feel to put them on my side table or to like have them spilling out of my backpack I feel like it would make me seem really smart and and thoughtful and and busy and I could hide in them from people nowsometimes I hide my phone on a page and look at it while I look like I'm reading but I also read I have read this bookthis is tangle wreck by Janette wierson and this is a notebook I always have a notebook with me I like tuck Polaroids into them like that and I just always like to have it with me so I have a place to write things down and becreative I am terrified of colds I almost just brought in 10 vitamins for my 10 essential things I almost feel like I'd rather have like the Bubonic plague than a cold the things I really try to travel with are southern bang Langenen I'm sure that that's not how you really say it but it's how I read it it was recommended to me by anacupuncturist when I had gone through a period of like complet completely losing my voice for a long time I was trying to get my voice back and they were like drink this all day I think it's like kind of like a Wonder drink and it'sreally sweet and I like how it tastes and it's a yummy dessert drink and then there are these horrible disgusting things that I love um the lipso vitamin C and lipso glutathione I think I still have nodules I did for a while in a way that was debilitating and I've gotten them under control and one of the ways that I did that was with glutathione and then there's lip sumal vitamin C which I think most people know about and have also disgusting though not as disgusting as the glutathione thank you so much for watching I hope you found something that was useful and um uh please listen to my new album chaos angel

Target I usually do the ones from Walmart and my next essential is when I say essential can yall have like the word bouncing on the ball for me my next essential is my bloners are good to keep at all times because you never know what's around you or who's actually you know looking at you and I use these in the club sometimes to scope any females out that's in the back I use these you get to see who in the back you get to see anybody breaking in your car cuz I'm staying land they and broke in my car a couple times it's been so long since used I don't know which way I this blurry can you see me it's blurry yeah cuz you're not doing it right back up a little bit I don't think we can look at this Adam  apple you spray a roach uh usually probably 8 to 10 times and it'll be on his back but you got to come back cuz sometimes they be leaving especially in hotel rooms I just spray my bed down I take the sheets off I just spray it down so no no roaches in at home just Hotel no they definitely there that's why I got it is everything okay at home yes everything good at home what is that that's 80 sometimes when I don't have an answer I just letay him answer it so I recommend you guys 10 out of 10 raid is definitely dope and the definitely ways to use this use this to kill roaches and other bugs avoid from your eyes so that's how you use it ramen noodles I prefer cup noodles

GQ Videoseries,with a lot of Polaroids I love having this particularly when I'm on set with a bunch of beautiful actors and beautiful sets and locations I kind of just feel like a duty to capture everything and they're really fabulous pieces of history that I get to like take home with me there's so many good ones from Euphoria and from cuckoo there's a really beautiful body of photographs that I think I'm going to put out in the World  somehow these are my jeans I have a lot of jeans but this is basically the only pair that I wear I got them a few years ago they're Marella in general like with a pant I love like a relaxed fit and the color is kind of perfect I mean obviously the blue jeans go with just about everything they're not totally boring either they've got like this fun little detail with muslin peeking out of the pocket it's comfortable I sleep in them a lot of the time I first got interested in fashion like when I was a kid and I was drawing a bunch of comics and I realized like what I liked about making characters was drawing their outfits next we have Cho eye patches I wasn't really an eye patch girly until maybe like last year I fly so much that that obviously dries out your skin on the airplane and it's like a lot for your skin to go through these are like a nice way to get some moisture back in your face and you feel kind of like fabulous when you're cooped up on the plane you have like a bunch of Goo which I think just really kind of helps with like the hydrating limit you can like you know put it wherever I mean they're really cute they look like little sea creatures or something I'm not going to put it on my face cuz I have makeup right now and I'm still in the middle of a photo shoot but like it's super gooey and kind of cold and sweet they're really yummy and they smell  good I've like drawn and painted ever since I was a kid I mean I thought I was going to like do art with my life and it's still something that I want to keep up Cho sent these watercolors to me as a gift they are just gorgeous pigments I'm going to show a few little pigments just to like show how gorgeous they are wet and on the paper this one is one of my favorites cuz it's like so kooky and kind of acidic it's gorgeous it sort of maintains like some moisture in the palette you can kind of like Gunk it up and layer which is really nice cuz sometimes watercolor can feel really thin and then you have to like let it dry and do a bunch of layers when I've directed music videos I usually watercolor storyboards cuz I'm like very Visual and getting my ideas across yellow is my favorite color in the world it's so so bright it's like a much quieter sort of less social form of art than what I do for a living I want to use these for the rest of my life it's so pretty these are tug kits by a brand called unclockable I really wanted to bring these and show these off today because they are really useful for the dolls or anybody who needs to tuck I have them on my rider for every photo shoot
GQ Videoseries,I ever do it's like cute and it comes with detailed instructions on how to do a tuck because nobody likes tucking it's not really fun beforehand I kind of just been winging it with like tape sometimes even duct tape which is not fun this is like the most comfortable option I've ever had and I also just love that it's like by trans people for Trans people these are my headphones I prefer a wired headphone these are great for the plane or being on set and you want to tune everything out I use music as like an emotional cue sometimes for work even within e I would have different playlists for like different relationships I had with different characters I also find just in life I kind of listen to something like really intensely until I Tire it out and then I just like don't touch it for a while and then when that pie of music comes back into my life it's sort of like when you smell like a scent and it takes you back to a point in life when that scent was around I feel like music does the same
GQ Videoseries,for me like if I ever miss you Pure Heroin by Lord was like my album to kind of get in like to that angsty high schooler teenage girl who sad head space I would listen to Pure Heroin a lot this is a little snail plushy not to say that I need this particular snail but I do need something of this squishy sweet nature I just saw this when I was in Japan and my heart left I knew that it needed to come home with me so I've literally had this with me for like two months straight now it's really great because it fits in a purse or a pocket whenever I need something to touch or look at because it's so cute wait can I curse whatever it's like a binky is honestly what it is if that makes me an adult baby then so be it I have a really big problem with overhead lighting it's you know something that's hard to have a problem with because it's everywhere all the time but I do what I can to control locations and circumstances where I can this light in particular is by a brand called Halo edition the light that these produce is like a huge orb it makes a giant Circle and it does this just like gorgeous Gra rant you can turn off all the lights in like your trailer and bask in beautiful sunset it is also very important to have portable forms of entertainment with me cuzz there's a lot of sitting around and waiting when you're an actor or traveling or whatever so I usually like to key cards around and these ones are really special because they're Pono themed my sister gave these to me they have beautiful stills of the movie they're so cute and Pono is like one of my favorite films ever one of my favorite games in the world is called faral it's a dice game you actually need six dice but I have four here so I couldn't play farle right now if I wanted to it gets really competitive it's kind of like half strategy half chance to kind of raise the stakes a little you can bet I did get and haway to play faral with us she got really into it before she had to start um filming we had to finish the game without her because you know she was the lead of the movie and she had a lot to do but when she was involved she was in on it and she was really good at it  also these might just look like legal pads but these kind of singlehandedly keep my life together I'm a to-do list person it's the only way I can remember to do anything these come with everywhere it's lined and there's a little margin for the check box in there checking it off is the best feeling it's pretty up there as far as like dopamine hits go if for some reason I don't have this I will try and make a to-do list like in the notes on my phone I never look at it again I don't  know

GQ Videoseries,this one was like the industry standard one when I discovered it and it's still pretty great I just don't use the wind screen as much sorry but that this isn't about that this is about this one is about me today hey what's up GQ my name is Marquez brownley AKA MKBHD and these are my 10 Essentials [Applause]  all right so this is the camera of choice most of the time when you're seeing videos shot on my channel most of it is footage from a red digital camera and people always ask like oh oh you're just talking about them cuz you you're getting paid or you get like a discount or something like that no no no no no no I've paid full price for every single red camera we've ever bought but I like these things a lot they are surprisingly good at being both a cinema camera and a onean rig which I I require I need to be able to shoot first person video one of my favorite lenses the 24 to35 by Sigma it's got these handles for me I've got a gdu plate I've got batteries that last 45 minutes to a charge or so it'll be 8K footage and it'll be raw footage which means I can change things like white balance after I shoot which is super useful you might get all kinds of weird crazy lighting out in the field and I don't even have to worry about it in the moment I just shoot what I can bring it back back into the edit and turn it to looking beautiful so I love these cameras and uh they're also very  expensive so this a frisbee so I happen to play Ultimate Frisbee on a club team I play for the professional team from New York this is the club team shout out to Pony pride of New York World Champs 2022 like there's a lot of good Ultimate Frisbee players in the New York City area if you didn't know so I've been playing ultimate frisbee for oh boy carry the one 16 years since the beginning of high school I went to a high school in New Jersey called Columbia High School where the sport was invented in the' 60s and I started playing I played all four years of high school and then college and then after that so frisbee nice she caught  it so this is the laptop I do use a desktop computer at my desk but a lot of times I'm on the Go photo editing even video editing and so this is the laptop of choice this is a 16-in MacBook Pro it's not even the newest one I think it's the M1 Max so it's like 3 years old now I ended up just putting this dbrand skin on the laptop which makes it look black but it's got little icons this is part of a little Signature Series icon skin so this is my 16-in Macbook Pro not just any other generic silver 16in MacBook Pro this was one of the first laptops that was actually competent enough to handle the footage that I throw at it the plugins that I throw at it this has been a super reliable laptop happens to have awesome battery life and an awesome screen I had like a 4 and 1/2 hour flight recently I just popped the laptop open at the beginning of the flight edited for the entire flight basically made the entire video on the flight and didn't plug in once that's amazing so when I said pen I actually me like an actual pen okay so these fairly old school but I do carry these everywhere I go it's a pen and a Sharpie there is definitely a generational age somewhere between where people ask me for either a selfie or an autograph and it's mostly selfies for younger people and then uh some people do ask for autographs and if they don't have a Sharpie I have one and I have the pen cuz you never know when you're going to need to write something down that's why I always carry the Sharpie in the pen I carry two smartphones right pocket left pocket one Android phone one iPhone specifically my Android phone currently is the pixel 8 Pro and my iPhone currently is the iPhone 15 Pro honestly this will be a different phone next week and it was a different phone last week and I probably test and review 15 to 25 phones every year depends on how many come out honestly and the reason I carry two is just because they're very different and I have to remain in both worlds all the time I'm reviewing the newest iPhone when it comes out I'm reviewing the newest Android phones when they come out and there are certain things that some of them do better than the others if you're asking I do prefer the Android setup mostly that's the main phone that's the phone number that people get when they ask for it but the iPhone does certain things better with photos and videos and certain apps as well so two phones this is my backpack I car my backpack at least every weekday this is the peak design everyday backpack kind of my ideal backpack in a lot of ways I haven't found one better than it for what I like to do which is carry my normal work stuff my computer a bunch of charging cables batteries whatever a trip demands hand lotion hand sanitizer the water bottle goes over here it's a pretty complete bag basically every year of school through the end of college I would try a new backpack I don't love most backpacks but this one ended up being the one that I came back to I really like this latch design at the top accessibility wise it's light it's durable and it's red and black red and black are my colors it's a bit of a limited edition bag because they don't make one with the MKBHD stamp with red threads you have to know somebody to get one like this I knew somebody I've got two pairs of headphones here one pair wireless and one pair wired these are airpods Max I like them a lot they're a little heavy they're still lightning they're not perfect this is a weird case that doesn't fold but they pair immediately with the iPhone and they are solid quality headphones with great noise cancellation these are in your monitors these are by a company called 64 audio wired headphones like really really really good earbuds is how I would describe them great for editing great for music listening in the past couple years of editing videos I've started focusing on more of the little details of it one of them being sound design and in your monitors do a really good job of not only blocking out the outside world but feeling really close to the way it's actually supposed to sound it's got a bunch of drivers on the side that's totally unnecessary you might just have a single driver in your earbuds but they sound really good this is the water bottle I carry everywhere it's a bit of a nearest resolution of mine to drain more water and the only way I'm defining that is I want to finish three of these in a day this is a MKBHD water bottle it's also a super early one which is why it looks kind of beat up cuz the first one that ever got made is mine I think it's like 16 or 18 Oz I don't even know if that's enough water I just feel like when I drink three in a day I drank a lot of water  so this is an Apple Watch you know what's funny this is an Apple Watch Ultra 2 too and you could also call it a limited edition because they recently had to remove the blood oxygen sensor from it to keep it in stores this one still has it long story the point is this is like a everyday wear Fitness tracking notification delivering accessory that I basically wear every day so the battery life on something like this is the main reason why I use it over a regular Apple watch but I still have to charge it once in a while so I charge it when I'm showering and I charge it when I sleep you may have noticed I'm wearing it on my right wrist you may have already started typing a comment asking if I'm Lefty no I just didn't realize that people wear watches on their left hands and so when I started wearing watches I just started wearing them on the right cuz I do everything with the right so it felt like that was how it should be I was wrong look at that I feel like I became a pretty big shoe guy in the past couple years and I finally got a chance to design my own shoes you can't see but behind the camera it's snowing and sleeing outside in New York City and these are perfect for that because these are also waterproof and weatherproof thankfully I was able to have a gigantic say in basically every piece of the design of these shoes which was a learning process because I'd never designed a shoe before and the first few prototypes looked super cool but were functionally terrible because it was all Aesthetics and so I got to work with Adams on making them okay I care about the silhouette a lot the elastic laces the pieces where I have little accent colors and things like that and then forming it into an actual functional shoe that like works and is durable it's like surreal to actually be holding it but yeah I wear them every day thanks for watching GQ this has been Marquez brownley and hope you learn something new maybe about Ultimate Frisbee maybe about shooting editing videos whatever it is the has been my essentials thanks for watching
GQ Videoseries,hey I'm Le Stanfield and these are my  essentials yeah sunglasses you never know when you might need them you got to protect those twinkly linkly usually I have darker ones where you can't really tell who I'm looking at and it's fun to just look at people and they don't know but they're also one of those things that sort of act as a tool of protection when I'm out in public sometimes if I have these on uh people know that I'm not giving them eye contact because sometimes when you give eye contact it invite someone it's not that I don't like people it's just that you know sometimes you want to Zone and so these help do that and also they just look cool right maybe I'm not selling it they're both utilitarian and just  cool ow headphones particularly airpods they block out sound they're good for the airplane I'm constantly listening to instrumentals listening to music when I'm reading scripts reading different things I'm always playing some sort of music instrumental they're good to kind of be in your own Zone and kind of block out the world and just like Zone in I like a lot of electronic music I like a lot of like dance hul I like dub stuff that like feels like it's in rhythm with the heartbeat I often lose my airpods which is why I have this a little handy lanyard it's color coded too because often lose them and they all look the same they're just white so mine's green so if you ever see a green one it's mine yes hard drive I take a lot of photos you can keep your photos on them wherever you are you can upload them to whatever system you're near edit them also keep music in hard drive I'm constantly making music on the go hard drives does a body good I like a hard drive that's durable when you're on on the go you know you're moving around you might drop it sometimes you don't want it to be too like destructible so you want to have a hard one hard body one I also like them to be quite small cuz when you're traveling with other things I probably have now about five hard drives one for photos one for music another one for music another one for music and another one for like stems and sessions of Music I've always got a hard drive nearby they're never far Out Of Reach I love taking photos it's just super fun to capture moments that you you'll never have again you'll never see again there's something real beautiful about that I really enjoy these cameras it's a really like wellb built camera and uh right now I have a really wide lens on it cuz I I I typically like to get like close portraits with bokeh in the back is kind of fun but I wanted to get some like wide portraits to kind of mix it up a little bit I'm sort of chronicling the press run so I like to get like why things I want to Chronicle this right now actually what a beautiful bunch oh my God I did this film called the photograph my character he uh took uh took photo so I I figured I'd just pick up the camera to try to learn it and when I started taking photos I was like wow this is like really really beautiful it's something you can like just do by yourself and kind of just like be in the zone of it you look at the world differently you're kind of just more sensitive to everything and you kind of appreciate things more it became something that I felt was like I could continue doing this so just been doing it ever  since yes liquid IVs stay hydrated my friends it's important but like it says it multiplies the hydration you know you pour it in the water ah you feel so hydrated it's important you know when you're using your mind a lot when you're performing when you're trying to understand and comprehend text having a liquid mind is better than an ashy one so I try to get some Loop lubrication in there uh try to stay hydrated take this out pour it in the Water Shake It Up and you are hydrated it has like a little like lemon kind of vibe to it but it's really it makes your drink a little bit thicker um and just a little bit more interesting with a little tinge of lemon which makes it easier to do all day you know you got the little flavor in there so yeah it's  good  and here's the water with the liquid IV in it by the way I always keep a big water bottle near me always good to have water because again it's good to be hydrated I pour the little Ivy in here makes it all nice and foggy sometimes it's fun to do that and uh yeah it does a body good are you ready for this ASMR water with the liquid IV  yes yes mangoes I just love mangoes dried mangoes are really good they're easy and uh taste good sometimes I put a little chili on them things they're kind of feeling surprisingly they F you up always got to have some mangoes with me you never know I think this is like the perfect balance of sweet in these ones pretty fire they're dry but they're not like Parts your throat dry no matter where you go everyone will join mango I mean if you don't like mangoes I kind of question you as a person I question your  morality hot sauce is God you can put it on anything and it makes everything taste great spicy is amazing I love spicy food which is why I put Chile on my mangoes and hot sauce you got to always have it with you because you never know when a meal might surface and uh it's definitely going to need hot sauce so you put some hot sauce on it and you enjoy I've kind of went all the way up to habanero so far and that is typically the where I like to stay that's my happy place um but I'm interested in exploring hotter options uh if they're available so yeah let's do it let's go I like some spice especially on popcorn travel with hot sauce all the time it's always in my backpack it's always on set um you know sometimes on set food can be great sometimes it can be like all I want to taste is the hot  sa my little ring and this is my ring that pays homage to natives I really love it because I I really like history I like American history and um the natives have historically just like been really in tune with nature and have appreciated nature and I love that and this Chieftain you know reminds me of that and just reminds me of like the the beauty of being like grounded it was something that I was like really inspired by I was in New Mexico you know I love the way the houses and the buildings are built there out of mud and um so I inquired about that at this Museum once and they you know telling me more about it and I saw this like Native American just like ring this this head this ring it didn't have diamonds in it but I was like yeah let's uh let's add some diamonds so I went to ice box and then they gave me this nice little iced out one where did you come from  beanie yeah I love beanies I usually like beanies that are more like Skully like they're closer to the skull I typically don't like a lot of like flop in the beanie like I don't really like this like if I can do this it's just it's not good it's got to be pulled down to a point where there's very little left to the imagination at the top you know I never want to get just like pulled by the bean you got to you know you got to be careful uh it could get snagged on things so try to keep it kind of close to the skull keep your head head nice and warm it's soft they're easy a companion that I always want to have with me something soft something nice pops right on the head

GQ Videoseries,"hey GQ I'm Chris Stapleton and these are my  essentials all right for this essential first let me go get it this chair was the chair that was in my breakfast area growing up there were there were four of them originally and they were kind of a yellow vinyl when I was a kid my mother kind of recovered this one in the late ' 80s I think and it kind of traveled around with me um kind of went to college with me or VAR living situations with me but it's always been with me it's been my guitar chair that I kind of sit around and play guitar in every time I go make a record the chair comes with me and right now I get to sit in the chair for a different reason but that's the story of the chair this is a 1964 Jazz Master this was the first nice old guitar I ever got and it was a gift from my wife when I received it it it looked very uh mint I kept it that way for a while and then I started feeling bad it's a tool to me and it's meant to be used and so I I've used it over the years and it's certainly in the room for everything that I've ever recorded even if it's not played on everything I've ever recorded it's played on a lot of things that I've recorded you can see over the years it it turned very not meant just from use but that's okay this is all Hest where it's been a good tool and has served me well generally I'm not playing an electric guitar in a riding setting uh unless I'm there in a studio with the whole band the guitar that I would choose to sit in a room with is about to come in  this is a 1950 something Gibson LG2 it has a replaced neck on it and replace tuners and body probably Ed it as a canoe paddle there's like mud in it and so many repaired cracks that you probably can't count them I bought this guitar very early in my songwriting career and most songs that I've written um have been on this guitar these are the foundations of most of the music that I've made in my songwriting and record making career I paid about $380 for this guitar it took about $900 to make it work correctly but it's earned its keep beyond that and I don't know all the stories that made it look like this but it's certainly been with me for a lot of good ones I have a friend of mine who talks about playing guitar in the way that you have to kind of throw your whole body into it when you're in the moment of singing or playing um if you're not putting all of yourself into it then you're not going to get that but I I try to do that at all times but certainly there's moments where you know know all right this is not the one we're just working this out that you're not doing that but when it's go time uh whether it's a live show or um recording something yeah you just go there if you didn't get there all the way that wasn't the one you know the jeep that we're going to take a look at is a 1979 Jeep chair key that my wife purchased for me after my dad passed away she caught me looking at it online said hey let's get out of here we flew Phoenix are Arizona and drove it back uh to Nashville it was all original at the time and had uh you know like 77,000 Mi on it and I warned her that we would not make it all the way and we did we did lose an alternator along the way but since it made its way back home she kind of regifted it to me as uh in a way that she kind of hooked it up for some guys at hendri racing to kind of redo the whole"
GQ Videoseries,so it's as modern as it can be mechanically and every nut bolt and screw on it is either refurbished or new so it's a
GQ Videoseries,that I can get inside and once again have lots of great memories it's special to me in way that I could never get rid of it and hopefully never wreck in it in this Jeep I wrote the song traveler my wife was asleep in the passenger seat I was driving and the sun was coming up over the horizon I wrote the song while I was driving we wind up stopping in Gallop New Mexico that night and I had to you know take the guitar inside and figure out how to play it so that that was how that song got written and ultimately went up being the the title track of uh debut album so the Jeep has significance in in that way if you're a chef or a knife collector you know what this is It's a knife rule this one belong to my dad and where I grew up in Eastern Kentucky knives would be given as a sign of respect they were things that one man would give to another man so my dad when he passed away there were quite a few knives I didn't really collect knives or anything like that previous to that but I had inherited some from my grandfather and these are from my dad a lot of them from my dad this one in particular I know was his and I hold and I think of them they're from various times periods of time a lot of Case Knives them are from the 40s up to the 60s 7s you hold on to them you know this one was my grandfather's um he was a knife collector but my dad was not necessarily and I think about them a lot I think when I open these things up and touch them I can feel connected to them in a way that maybe I'm not otherwise so it kind of got me when they passed away I kind I kind of turned into I would I would pick up knives and as I was thinking about doing this I was thinking about the sign of respecting and I really started getting in my own head about it thinking about well when I buy a knife am I trying to buy self-respect I don't really know maybe that's what I'm doing I don't know but I but I I do it to feel connected to my father and my mother's father who had the all these knives this is my grandfather's flag he was a soldier in World War II he was buried and this was the flag that was on his coffin and they handed over to the family at the end I have given the honor of getting to keep this with me and always kind of remember the things that he had to do so we get to do the the things that we get to do I keep this in my office this stays in my office and uh if I'm in my office riding it's sitting right there by the wall and it's always in the room he was a man with a 10th grade education that wound up engineering for a multinational cult Corporation he was is a testament to hard work and very very um particular in the things that he did so all those things you know inform some of what I do I'm sure this is a hat my hat that I've worn for a long long time I had a different one years ago that was similar my wife gave it away to a fan at a club one night she's like you can get another one right and I was like well no not really they don't don't make that anymore so I I had to hunt for something similar this one's better you know there was a reason gave that one away I always kind of loved crazy hats and the guys that wore them the company that makes these hats is a company called Charlie one horse and this was made in the late '70s early ' 80s and I found it a New Old Stock and I've worn it nearly out there's not a there's not a band in it anymore this one's on slap legs really so hopefully my career will last longer than this hat will because it's very very fragile at this point but the guys uh and and the ladies and the crew have have dubbed it precious so it has a name it's a hat with a name mainly because it's fragile so that's the Hat keeps the lights out of your eyes once again it's utilitarian but it's also decorative it's been with me on everything that I've done and when people think of what I do I think they think of this hat probably as much as they think of me my great grandmother made this blanket she gave it to my dad when he went away to college and it sat around in chairs in my house growing up if it was a cold night this was what you pulled out I don't know when it would have been made maybe the 60s but these were all pieces of material that my great-grandmother had saved from mending things it got worn to the point where the edges of it were kind of worn off and my mother actually kind of repaired some of it so it has that kind of touch to it too if I was running out of a burning building it's it's the
GQ Videoseries,that I would grab in my house you know so if I want a blanket this is the one I want this is a pair of boots made for me customed by the uh lucasi company I was on a radio tour in El Paso before traveler came out or anything like that lucasi makes really really nice boots they take you up to this kind of Willy Wonka room when you do the factory tour and they're like hey we'd like to make you a pair of boots pick out anything you want I think they were surprised when I was like okay I just want this kind of very plain pair of boots they have much more expensive versions of things I like no I I want something I'm going to wear every day and that's what I did with these for the longest time these were my everyday Boot and I wore these everywhere and did everything in these boots I love things that have genuine wear on them as well and so there's a lot of that I look at these boots and I think about things that we've done a lot of those things happened in these boots they're special to me in that way I always have a a Filson jacket running around with me somewhere it's this kind of wax cot material it's just kind of allp purpose if it's raining if it's windy or you just need a jacket it works out for that so it's tough you can abuse it toss it around if a budy guy was in a band with it used to say things like you can get your work done in it I don't know it's just a nice utilitarian
GQ Videoseries,that works my personal style is absolutely completely utilitarian I wanted just to to uh function as a as a garment it was a philson jacket that I wore on the sing of the national anthem for the Super Bowl so it works in that setting as well thank you for taking the time to uh watch My Essentials and I hope maybe you learned something about me that you didn't know or if you didn't thanks for joining us anyway

GQ Videoseries,to have for fuzzies you can't go wrong with a great pair of sunnies these are just easy black St lauron Sunglasses if I really like a pair of sunglasses I try to get multiple pairs because I have done dogs and sometimes they get chewed up and ruined so I have probably at least like two or three pairs of these on Deck peptide lip treatment this one is the clear version which is just like my all-time favorite go-to this is our strawberry glaze scent that I'm obsessed with this is my favorite flavor and this is our peptide lip tint which is new these are our tinted version of the peptide lip treatment I love this fresh nudie color and the reason I like to have both is because I just don't know what my mood is going to be and sometimes I want a little color sometimes I just want hydration maybe it's like the clear for the plain ride and then the color when I get to where I'm going so I do like to have both with me at all  times scrunchie um I sometimes just get annoyed having my hair in my face want to be able to put my hair back I put a lot of skin care on on the plane so I need to be able to get my hair out of my face and I just always like having a scrunchie with me it's either on my wrist or in my bag don't go anywhere without a scrunchie I don't know if I have a lucky scrunchie I definitely have ones I've had for a really long time though since I was like a teenager that I still use this day this is not one of them but we love this one in the same world of hair items this little mini brush my hair gets really really Tangled and naughty especially if I'm like tossing and turning sleeping on a flight I'm kind of picturing this is like a really long flight I'm going somewhere far away I like to have a brush with me kind of everywhere I go because you just never know when you're going to need it so this you can see has been used this is just a really pretty nude lip liner that I also like to keep with me because I feel like if I at least can do a lip it brings some life to the face after a long long flx cuz at least if I have sunglasses and then I can do a lip I can live with that so this is the uh Makeup Forever pencil in anywhere caffeine which is my  favorite these are Drew slippers I love to bring Slippers With Me on the plane because they're just cozy these ones specifically are just my favorite and really really really really comfortable so must have this is a little compact mirror of course need it to apply my skin care apply my lip combos whatever you know I think a mirror is pretty self-explanatory so just this little mirror and that was it the mirror was the 10th
GQ Videoseries,one of my everyday essentials is my security guard Kevin come say hi to the people does they look happy hi GQ I'm Ed Sheran and these are my  essentials Kevin has spent pretty much every day of my life with me since 2015 he was there on the birth of both of my children he was on my honeymoon yeah we're we're best friends and you know it's a deterrent people see him and they go okay maybe I won't robed what's the craziest story that comes to mind out of the last 8 years none I can say you it's the strong silent type I've never seen Kevin in an altercation and I think that's what makes Kev a good security guard he gets me out of the danger before it's even presented itself he's not the only one as well he's got he's got a few few mates hey few of us yeah so this is
GQ Videoseries,this is tingly Ted's hot sauce I did a TV commercial for Hines ketchup cuz I like Hines and I got in contact with them and said I've got a commercial idea for you if you want to do it together and then they asked should we do another commercial for Hines ketchup and I said I'd actually want to create my own sauce I had this idea for tingly Ted a while ago I find some hot sauce a bit too runny and watery not fit for purpose so I wanted to create something that was totally fit for the purpose that I I use hot sauce on like every everything I'm a spice addict but I wanted something with the taste that I like and a consistency and something you can cook with as well so this I mean I go through bottles and bottles and bottles of this every single week I'd have it on breakfast lunch Burgers nuggets I'd cook fajitas with it cook pasta cook curries there's two flavors out of the moment but we're bringing out a uh I like to call it the hoop hurter and that will be coming out very soon and anyone that really really likes their Rings stinged then you know next essential is uh Apple TV I travel a lot and I find myself sat in a hotel room on my own a lot and this has all the streaming platforms on and I can basically wherever I am in the world if I've got like you know an hour to kill I can go on choose a TV show choose a movie and and watch that I mean this this comes with me everywhere I put it in my dressing room I put it in my hotel room I have it at home it's yeah a very useful bit of Kit being on Game of Thrones was it was cool it was it was very cold and they gave me thermal everything
GQ Videoseries,and I was like ah it's Northern irand it's not going to be that cold and it was like I really regretted the decision not wearing thermals the reaction to me being on Game of Thrones was obviously not as glowing uh and positive as how I felt about it but what I would say to people is if someone asked you to be on your favorite show you'd say yes too so one of my essentials on the road is having a watch like this which is a uh it's just a regular G-Shock this is I did a subtract Edition I love collecting watches but I think having a watch that you can wear anywhere and everywhere and you can swim with this you can run with this you could you could go to a club with this you can go but I wouldn't have to have a security guard and I always have this in my bag to wear at all times I love it so this watch uh was made for me for the mathematics tour and it's a a oneof one all the mathematics colors and symbols on it's basically a stage watch for me every weekend for the uh for the stadium shows but I basically bring both of these on the road this would be the everyday wear and this would be the stage watch another one of my essentials would be V5 hair wax this is texturizing gum I've used this not this particular one although this is about 11 years old this it's it's empty um yeah I've used this probably since I was about 13 uh I name dropped V5 in my song you need me I don't need you and they sent me a lifetime supply that say Edge Shar and's texturizing gum and when they said lifetime supply I've still got a lot of the supply and you know I'm barely halfway through it so it is definitely a lifetime supply yeah I've only ever used this on my hair and yeah I've run out which is why I'm wearing a hat today but yeah I know gel not for me matte clay not for me hairspray not for me it's all about the texturizing gum but then I don't know if anyone's going to watch this video and go oh I'd love to have hair that looks like EDS but if you [Laughter] do so this is another one of my essentials this is Paca raban million just a a spray this the same as the the texturizing G I've used this since I was about 16 the only reason I got it was cuz it looked fancy and I was 16 and you know I think the one I got was like this big as well it was like I got it with a voucher for Christmas but I've used it ever since and I guess like when you find your smell it's your smell I really think like I I meet a lot of people throughout the day and you know I think people look at me and they think he looks like he doesn't smell nice and I try to so this is is I think the
GQ Videoseries,that I use the most in the day this is my iPad Mini yeah I moved off a phone in 2015 and I didn't have any form of communication for about a year I was just like off everything and then when I got back to work for divid I was like I'm going to move back on to email everyone expects a reply to a text instantly with email for some reason culturally everyone's like yeah yeah yeah you can reply to that tomorrow and it's not like you're just spending your whole time on your phone and I have three folders I have personal work and Urgent for me to compartmentalize conversations rather than just having chaos it's helpful for brain space especially with a young family I actually write every single one of my songs on here as well so on notes all of my lyrics are written on here on uh voice notes as well all of my ideas for like guitar riffs and stuff like that so this is a an important bit of Kit and it's really smashed up like really really smashed up I made a load of songs with Jay Balvin and he was so offended that my iPad was so smashed up and I was using like it was literally like holes in it that he like bought me a new one then and there and yeah that's this one and it's smashed up so Jose thank you but it's it's the same as the one you replaced these uh headphones I have like seven pairs of these cuz I keep losing them and then and then finding them again so these are don't know these aren't the pros yeah I think headphones are essential for anything I mean for me checking mixes of my music I video call my kids and stuff like that so to be able to be in private basically in public I think is quite important the three artists I would listen to for the rest of my life I think the Beatles I'm going to choose artists that have a wide wide wide catalog cuz there are some artists that are my favorite artists but have like two or three albums and if it was for rest of my life I'd want to have a wide catalog I would say the Beatles I would say Eminem and for  events so another one of my essentials would be a corkscrew bottle opener for uh wine I stopped drinking Spirits a couple of years ago and I've kind of uh channeled all my energy into into red wine yeah I've been caught out a few times where you're in a situation where you have a bottle of wine and you want to drink it and I've learned how to push a cork down now and basically open a bottle without a cork screw but sometimes especially wearing a white t-shirt it's dangerous you push it in and goes all over you so I would say a cork screw is essential in my bag I would say a bottle of wine as well but I think that it that's not essential to bring with you at all times cuz you could pretty much anywhere in the world you can find a bottle of wine this is the only
GQ Videoseries,that I carry on my person apart from a watch I have a wallet I used to carry a wallet with cash in it and yeah cash just seems to be a
GQ Videoseries,of the past now so I just literally have a credit card I feel like I could be caught out in any situation and be fine with even if I didn't have a watch just a credit card I think you could get yourself out of a few binds Just One credit card yeah and I've got a card that someone gave me for counseling custody and meditation that it sometimes has cards in there you know that people give me and I forget to take out but yeah I should probably take that one out I've watched so many of these and it's nice to be the one being watched today i' I've always wondered about what my essentials would be and I really wanted to pick things that were actually in my bag and yeah thank you so much for having me and hope you enjoy the next person whoever it is

GQ Videoseries,hey GQ I'm Olivia Rodrigo and these are my 10 Essentials  this is like an industrial strength weighted blanket I think someone gave me one of these for Christmas one year now I get everyone else this for Christmas because it's like the best gift I've ever been given some people hate it some people say it feels like suffocating but to me it's just the best type of Suffocation I love it every time I get into a hotel bed I like get in and I'm like hmm something's not right because I'm missing this and it's actually very cumbersome to travel with so I sometimes just have to do without it like I don't know how you'd put this in a little carry-on feels so safe right now this is very important this is my actual Journal it's kind of scary to have it out in the open here I'm so terrified of losing my journals that's like my worst fear when I was kind of having trouble overcoming lots of the pressure of of making a sophomore record I read the hardest way in one of the big tenets of the artist's way is doing your morning pages so it's like three pages long hand stream of Consciousness in the morning like first
GQ Videoseries,you do when you wake up I think for me it's just nice to be able to write something down and not judge it in the moment I think that's the whole point of doing the learning pages is just to be like this is stream of Consciousness what I'm feeling I'm not gonna judge it too harshly or wonder if it's gonna make any money or be criticized or whatever this
GQ Videoseries,really lovely about that I feel like I've been pretty diligently keeping some sort of journal or diary since I was like 13 years old and so I just have this like Rolodex of all of my feelings for a long time and it's nice to kind of look back at issues that I thought were going to be world ending and be like ah that worked out totally fine it made me who I am that kind of just like puts things into perspective you know  so these are the guts Rings rings in general are a huge essential for me I don't go anywhere without these rings I feel very naked without them if I ever go on vacation or something and get tanned I have like weird tan lines on my hands because I refuse to take my rings off my producer's wife Emily actually made these she's an incredible jewelry designer I named the album guts for many different reasons I love the word I think it has so many cool meanings means intuition it means courage spilling your guts is just like telling all your secrets to everyone which I feel like is just very synonymous with songwriting and it's just a cool four-letter word I think it looks cool it's very like evocative I don't know they all are kind of sentimental to me this one my producer Dan got from me for Christmas and he's one of my closest friends and my parents got me this one for my 18th birthday it's a vintage store and I think it's really special this one my makeup artist on High School Musical I was filming this show and I was really close with her and she helped me through a lot and she got me this ring when we wrapped and it says write the songs of of your heart and on the inside it says love Heidi and Dottie June which is her dog her little French Bulldog actually left for the Grammys two years ago and I forgot my rings at home and I had to freak out and luckily someone was still home and I made them go to my house and get the rings and bring them to me because I was convinced that it was going to be a terrible night if I didn't have my rings it was some weird
GQ Videoseries,I was actually Tick-Tock influenced into buying this there's like a subculture on Tick Tock that's just so obsessed with the Stanley Cup and what you put in it and the flavored Waters and the soda concoctions and I was like I need this this looks like it'll change my life and it completely did I've gotten actually so many of the people on my team and so many my friends on the Stanley grind with me I did live in Utah for a while and Utah is the land of like specialty craft sodas this is like what they put the sodas in so it's like Diet Coke and like coconut creamer and like lemon juice and like all of this fun stuff to like doctor up your sodas I'm into that I'm very into that it's really fun the
GQ Videoseries,is skinny pop I consume so much skinny pop I inhale it Like Oxygen it is just my favorite snack there's one open bag of skinny pop on my piano at all times on my desk at all times and then in the kitchen at all times open like just ready for me to consume I truly lots of days will eat like this entire entire
GQ Videoseries,so good I will bring this into the movie theater because it's so much better than the movie theater popcorn to me I'll just sneak it into my bag oh well let's see what other flavors they have kettle corn I've never tried that popcorn mini cakes wow there's a whole skinny pop Cinematic Universe I need to try  this is my favorite perfume it's the baccarat Rouge 540. so good I have a candle of it too that I burned in my house I've never was super into perfume before I smelled this one and I'm like this this is the one for me because I don't love like smelling like candy or like flowers or something but this just smells like sort of like you could maybe possibly just naturally smell this way if you're like an angel or something it like doesn't smell like any smell that I could place lots of people say that like if they'll like smell this scent and I'm like somewhere else they'll think of me and that's a very high compliment this is my family and they are definitely one of my 10 Essentials I need them for everything my mom and my dad I'm an only child and this is us at Rockefeller Center during Christmas time last year yeah I love my family I wouldn't be anything without them I adore them going to New York this time was a really fun time I really love traveling with my parents I think it's so fun to get to go new places with them and I saw the Barbie movie the other day with my mom and I was like wow it's a Transcendent experience this is my favorite book I think it's the only book that I've read more than once it's like the creative person's Bible I've made so many of my friends read it I like recommend it to everyone I know I just think it's so incredible it's it's all about like creativity and discipline and the anxieties that come along with creativity and how to remedy those and it's just it's amazing Elizabeth if you're out there changed my life with this one it was so good I actually read this for the first time while I was making sour and I actually don't think that the album would have turned out the way that it did had I not read this book it was so instrumental in my creative journey I literally cannot leave the house without it not being hyperbolic I go everywhere with this I took Accutane for the first time this year I had bad teenager skin and my lips were so dry all the time and now I carry this with me everywhere I go because it's just so chapstick put it on anything put on wounds the opportunities are endless with Aquaphor I feel like all these items I'm just doing commercials for these brands  these are tar pics but I love playing guitar I love writing songs on guitar I'm slowly getting better took some lessons this year you know a few songs I learned how to play guitar like a lot of it was just by myself like learning songs I really love to play and when you're just learning how to play you know like pop songs in your bedroom you just kind of like do it intuitively like with your like your fingertips but it always does sound better when you use a pick but sometimes it's just you just go back to what you did when you were 15. my producer Dan is always trying to get me to play with the pick because he says it sounds better and I agree with him so I'm trying keeping these with me and I think I'm definitely better at piano I'm more comfortable playing it which is why I think sometimes it's nice to go out of your comfort zone and play something on an instrument you're not so familiar with so I've been playing a lot of guitar lately I wrote Love is embarrassing on guitar song Lacy was written on guitar there are a lot of guitar based songs on this album nice beautiful finger Plucky guitar and there's also some like really driving hard-hitting more Punky guitar so I gotta get my practice in before tour thanks GQ these were my 10 Essentials I hope you enjoyed check out my new album guts if you haven't already bye
GQ Videoseries,bueno Soy Gabriel García Bernal y pues estas son mis 10 cosas esenciales [Música] entonces pensé que algo que realmente me preocupa muchísimo cuando no cuando no viajo no tengo no está conmigo este no no los tengo pues este alcance son los tenis para salir a correr que es la manera en que conozco los lugares a donde trabajo los lugares que visito para mí es un escape así este fenomenal que me que me conecta con el sitio con el lugar conmigo mismo y que de alguna manera me mantiene un poco también cuerdo Y estos son los zapatos que utilizo estos son los que utilizo ahora por lo general esta marca también porque me vienen bastante bien son bastante delgaditos y muy muy ligeros y como que no me lastimo es un gran momento así como de convivencia de tranquilidad de alguna manera de una muy buena manera de despertar también y como que no llego a ese punto de que a veces con el café pasa que como que llego y medio que me quiebro durante el día en cambio con el mate como que me mantengo así como tranquilo no me pone tan no me pega tan duro y eso me gusta mucho el mate que es este la hierba que es como más Ahumada esa me encanta bueno Esto es mi cuerda para saltar la soga para saltar que desde que empecé a entrenar boxeo hace varios años hace como unos 15 años más o menos empecé a agarrar la costumbre Y la verdad es que esta es la manera en la cual yo me caliento cuando antes de entrar a una escena en el set este por lo general agarro Y de pronto me voy a una esquinita por ahí y traca Taca taca me pongo a saltar tantito nada tres minutos cuatro minutos pero siento que empieza todo a fluir y que y que empiezo a concentrarme también este empiezo a agarrar un ritmo bueno y aparte estoy haciendo ejercicio aparte me estás me está haciendo bien también pero pero como que hay es una gran manera de calentar la verdad es que el café es como como algo que me viene muy bien Al despertar como a todo mundo pero creo que sin el café No no logro como que entablar un una organicidad del pensamiento como que no no cuadran las ideas y por eso me gusta por eso me viene bien no me gusta mucho al mediodía y a la tarde eso sino este me gusta en la mañana en la mañana pero definitivamente Al haber comido algo porque si no es como que cae demasiado fuerte no y es un golpe si es una patada de burro fuerte contra el sistema [Música] Si tuviera que elegir presidente este sería el presidente y estas serían de alguna manera el congreso mi estructura política se rige en torno al aguacate Y al plátano es como que de alguna manera sin esto durante el día no no logro entablar ningún ningún no no me alieno completamente de donde estoy es lo que necesito comer un plátano y un aguacate al día obviamente no no es así como lo más esencial Este puedo vivir sobrevivir sin hacerlo pero después de unos días siento que me hace falta sí creo que son como una base ya casi genética de que necesito como que esta composición de alimentos como para para llenarme durante el día será porque soy mexicano pues quizás bueno Estos son unos cuadernitos que podrían ser cualquier tipo de cuadernitos pero siempre tengo dos unos donde guardo o donde de alguna manera escribo todo lo que me lo que tengo que organizar lo que estoy haciendo cuando tomo notas cuando digamos que es como para para el día a día del trabajo de alguna forma obviamente lo comencé a hacer en un afán así este de organización y combinaba muchísimo las cosas que de pronto este me inspiraba y me ponía a escribir Entonces en este cuaderno se encuentra todo aquello se encuentra todo lo que sucede durante el día y lo que de alguna manera tiene que ver con con comunicación con el cosmos del cotidiano y este es uno que siempre tengo a la mano porque lo que escribo aquí es acerca de algún proyecto en el cual estoy o el que estoy por hacer es siempre se trata acerca de algo que estoy preparando siempre es algo en torno a un mismo tema que por lo general tiene que ver con una misma película Entonces si voy a dirigir una película esta sería el cuaderno de la película entonces lo que escriba de la película va Aquí lo que escribo sobre cualquier otras cosas de la vida van acá en este iPad en esta tablet es donde Leo las noticias Leo los distintos periódicos que Leo me encanta como estar un poco consciente de qué es lo que está sucediendo me siento responsable además que tengo que saber tengo que entender tengo que de alguna manera curiosear satisfacer esa inquietud y pues es a través del iPad que lo hago hoy en día pero antes me compraba el periódico esto es una pluma negra y luego tengo una una pluma Azul Por lo general que ahora no la tengo acá conmigo que esa pluma azul lo que hace Es que de alguna manera se vuelve como las acotaciones así como en un como en un guión o como en un texto dramático existen las acotaciones no de las indicaciones donde los personajes o sea indica lo que los personajes están haciendo eso lo hago en azul de alguna manera si es como los adverbios de alguna forma los utilizo más en azul no sé por qué pero empiezo a hacer como una especie como de paréntesis donde el azul es la la tinta que utilizo para ese tipo de tangentes de paréntesis que que que empiezo a abrir y luego a la pluma verde está la utilizo para subrayar de alguna manera ciertas palabras o ciertas ideas ciertas como cosas delicadas no es que sea no es que sea más importante que otra cosa es como que musicalmente o totalmente de pronto como que rompe con algo y eso me da la oportunidad de poder seguir otra cosa básicamente lo que hago es que siempre cargo con un libro de ficción y un libro no ficción no de ensayos y así por lo general de historia son los ensayos o a veces filosofía también pero sí por ahí y aquí entre esto debería de caer un libro de poesía acabo de terminar de una novela que fue la de El último encuentro de sandor marai que es un escritor húngaro y ahora voy a empezar este de cormac mccarthy que se llama de Passenger que es un nuevo libro no lo no lo ha arrancado todavía y este es de Mariana matsukato que es una economista fantástica y es un libro en torno a la economía y dice una guía para cambiar el capitalismo es muy interesante porque justamente no sé si este es el lugar para hablar de esto pero creo que evidentemente hay muchas cosas que tenemos que cambiar para poder tener un entorno y entender un poco mejor cómo es que podemos convivir en un entorno donde no nos acabemos todo lo que hay y donde no contaminemos y donde no destruyamos el lugar donde vivimos Bueno Este es un cbd una tintura de cbd en aceite que la verdad es que me encanta me encanta lo utilizo muchísimo para relajar para dormir la verdad es que yo nunca la compro como en tiendas por lo general lo que hago es que tengo unos amigos que las hacen y siempre cargo con una un ahí como un potecito que con un par de gotitas con eso ya estoy y me empieza a relajar bastante y lo utilizo no no todos los días pero siempre está bueno tener porque en determinados momentos que me tengo que dormir muy temprano o que tengo que descansar realmente o que te estoy completamente agotado y así utilizo un poquito y con eso me relaja bastante bien me aliviana me calma un poquito la mente y entonces entro como en un sueño bastante bueno y bastante reparador también entonces lo recomiendo bastante Bueno espero que que se hayan reflejado que se hayan proyectado Pues con las cosas que yo presenté aquí y obviamente las cosas más esenciales Pues no son cosas materiales estas son así como 10 objetos materiales que vienen bastante bien y que trascienden la cosa de objetos No solo son objetos Estos son plátanos son objetos algo mucho más es una gloria

GQ Videoseries,to me from my good friend the drama King the street sweeper DJ casely he made this for me with my graffiti name on it he put Dez TMT which is a huge honor growing up being a graffiti writer having that be so much a part of my identity part of the reality of my Urban experience Des one is one of the prominent Graffiti Writers of all time in history this is a beautiful reminder of meeting one of your Heroes and this is super special to me I can't believe I'm getting choked up I'm a little embarrassed he gave me a lot of belief in myself and my claim that maybe rap is something you do but hip-hop is something you live my playlist I'm all over the place but I'm I love that Golden Era of hip-hop you know Rakim is always on my my top five Big L and Jr the damager and Big Daddy Kane and I love still love Kumo D and I love the war between Kumo D and LL and you know it was kind of that Golden Era of hip-hop that brought the brands like you know Brand Nubian and uh jungle brothers and tribe and just this wonderfully inclusive era of hip-hop that was respectful of everybody in some capacity and it was about knowledge and progression it felt good  next
GQ Videoseries,that I can't live without it's my money clip money grip a money clip is so much better than a wallet for me because it's just you pop it out you got all your bills here can't go nowhere without a hundo this will buy me a coffee and a sandwich in New York I have a funny little Visa card that you can get clothes on that my mother-in-law gave me and I think it's got 50 bucks on here and I still haven't spent it I'm kind of a cash guy and then I have my Chicago Ventra card it's the Chicago version of this this is for the the L train the CTA I didn't have these forever because I was against them one of my favorite possessions is my metro card how do you get anywhere in New York without a metro card when people are too bougie to have a metro card I'm sorry for you sitting in traffic and breathing in those fumes when you be surrounded by wonderful New Yorkers in a sea of humanity and get wherever you need to go in all of the five boroughs I like tangible stuff this lion the Leo this is one of my essentials because it was a really difficult time in my life I had recently gotten stage fright here in New York on Broadway and then I ended up doing a play at Chicago Shakespeare cymbaline Sean cross who played Imogen the lead in the play and I played her Star-Crossed lover posthumous Leonidas which obviously Leonidas meaning the lion she gave me this afterwards and it was a long journey for both of us she's one of the country's Premier Shakespearean actresses Sean cross and I'm not she gave me this afterwards because we really came far in our friendship and going through a Shakespeare play The Bard's words are pretty difficult a lot of the time and it was really an accomplishment and the beginning to getting over my stage fright which took me about 10 years to get over and I'm still getting over it I still have stage fright but it was during the power show where I felt the freedom again to play and not to be quite distressed and have fun in the moment and I'm eternally grateful for that and this reminds me that I'm eternally grateful and I can conquer my fears a big bad lion ah foreign my next essential is a thank you card from a very special director named Martin Scorsese this is when I was doing Boardwalk Empire I had just done a tiny little role in Shutter Island and then I got casting Boardwalk Empire and it's also very special because on the same day that I got this thank you card from Martin Scorsese is the exact same day when I first met the woman who would become my wife so very special it took me a long time I've been acting 37 years because I was not successful but consistently acting mainly doing Theater in Chicago I never really claimed being an actor it wasn't until probably about 15 years ago that I felt like you know I'm an actor and a certain sense of of coming into my own being the person that I was becoming and owning it and Marty was incredible you know I'm in Chicago and I'm too humble I'm just happy to be here and stuff and he's like no no you're here for a reason stand up be proud put your chest out what do you got there in the notebook and I'm like oh I just wrote the backstory for this character he goes read me the whole
GQ Videoseries,so I ended up reading Martin Scorsese three full single line College ruled pages of my backstory of my character it made me feel really good and important and I'm grateful super grateful to him and it's kind of a that was kind of really a starting point for the rest of my career it says uh dear Joe it's good to be working with you again my name's Chris Easy that was my Martin Scorsese invitation  my next essential is the dog tags it says James Barr which is the character that I played in the Jack Reacher movie Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher movie why are these so important to me it was more than just the character but it was the relationship obviously I love Tom Cruise I love to work with Tom again he's a constant professional I can't say enough nice things about Tom Cruise a super nice guy always remembered my name consummate professional and demanded that you bring your A game and for all of those things but I met one of my best friends Jai Courtney I'm so grateful for the friends that I've made in the entertainment industry uh other actors because it's I think it's harder than you think there's such a weirdness in this business competitiveness judgmentalness jadedness so when you find the good ones you want to keep them close to play a pretty backwards awful murderer James Barr and to walk away with so many positive things is no small feet  not a lot I kept the bullet that Tommy used the blank to kill Angela but it is fun to look at I'm just like oh look at this this is the one that is the one that got her  step on this journey art from the Sakura family the first option I'm going to show you it's a charcoal drawing that my little niece did and I think she was six years old when she did this and my wife and I were just blown away Arwen you are an incredible artist don't ever stop and I have no idea what this means and I'm wondering if it you know a six-year-old or maybe she was eight but no older than that knew what necessarily this means either but it's like such a wonderful reason to make art it's just to express something I think everybody sees is love and unity and Oneness part two is my mom's painting of a sunset in New Buffalo Michigan isn't that unbelievable like every time I look at it I feel like it's a window and I'm actually watching the sunset my third
GQ Videoseries,is this box that my brother made for me for Christmas and I don't know which Christmas you probably can't see but there's a little Santa Claus on there done with crayons and it says here Joe I'm sorry for all the bad things I did I keep this box every single place I've ever lived I store different things in here oh and here's look there's ET my grandmother was an artist art was always something that she did my mother is an incredible artist and um I'm okay hey thanks for having me GQ I loved sharing my 10 Essentials right now and don't forget you gotta watch power book 4 Force September 1st not stops
GQ Videoseries,and I'm telling you now if you've got a hay fever or anything like that these are great hi I'm Joshua Connor and these are my essentials my campervan who I call Winnie she used to be called Winston I don't have her here so this is a photograph of her you can see a little glimpse into the inside that's a wood burning stove that's a fridge to refrigerate things that's a sink to wash things you get the gist and I lived in Winnie for a lot of last year I was shooting a film called La Camara in Italy and when he doesn't have a shower but I was camping out by Lake bolsena which is a very beautiful Lake in the middle of Italy and I washed myself in the lake and the only way to get shopping food was to use a canoe to go into the nearby Village so I was very fit and healthy for the end of it so my
GQ Videoseries,is this scrapbook I've been keeping scrapbooks for films and projects and characters for quite a long time and this is one of them this is the first page of my lucky mirror scrapbook La Mary is about a man called Arthur an archaeologist and he's digging for old Etruscan treasures and selling them to museums for lots of money and it's a kind of pirate trade in the 80s but really Arthur is searching for the soul of his lost fiancee he died but also for something Beyond life something that doesn't exist but whether it's death or the Unseen or something like that and so a lot of my research was just about our relationship to afterlife or to death sounds very miserable but it wasn't it was very joyful and the Etruscans saw life after death as more meaningful than life itself and I feel like nowadays we have less of a connection to spirituality and that notion so that was really interesting there's actually a poem that Elite the director gave to me when we started this film and then there's all sorts of bits in here like obviously images but I also will keep like bits of moss and lichen there's some of my drawings like bits of material there's all sorts of stuff in here but it's mostly about character stuff and bits of writing that I found and poems and images I like and that was a flower that I tried to glue in anyway so this is one of my scrapbooks this one's a very precious one to me because lucky Mara was a very precious film to me  next
GQ Videoseries,is this camera I am by no means a good photographer so I don't really know too much about it I'm pretty sure there's there's all sorts of bits on here that I don't really understand I will take it around me when I go in the van sometimes I really only take it when I go off camping or with mates the only time I used it professionally I once took photos of my friend Jesse Buckley using this camera and that was really good because I was showing off to Jesse making I think that I was a professional photographer and I wasn't they very kindly gave me a photograph assistant and he just told me how to do everything sounds good so my next
GQ Videoseries,is copy decks which is a glue a strong adhesive for Fabrics crafts carpets DIY solvent free acid free and easy to use didn't know any of those things but you'll I'll tell you what I'll just open up for you so it's kind of you can see it's sort of liquidy we've got quite a horrible smell to it actually but this stuff is amazing my grandmother used to use this I remember seeing it in her Studio but it's really good for if you like scrapbooking which I do like this one it's really good for sticking in photographs or anything really it just does sort of do everything one
GQ Videoseries,I discovered it doesn't do is are flowers like in my Nakamura scrapbook because it just doesn't seem to work so good for most things not good for if you wanted to stick a flower somewhere and then these scrapbooks are personal scrapbooks and just images and letters that I've sent or received or things that I like over the years one of the images in this scrapbook is of the artist Eve Klein Eve Klein was obsessed with the color blue the image is him jumping off this high wall trying to capture blue because the blue in the sky and the idea behind it is that the artist needs to take a leap of faith sometimes in order to capture the idea the the form that they're looking for when I first moved to London I was working three or four jobs I was trying to audition trying to make it as an actor so I quit my jobs and my mum was very concerned and thought you're not going to thrive very long in London without a job I got that postcard and I wrote on the back of it and said sometimes as an artist we need to take a leap of faith she still has it on her on the fireplace at home second image very quickly is a photograph Helen is a friend and I love her I wrote to her when I was 14 15. having read this book and I sent it to Helen the Bonham Carter there were all these characters and I thought oh well Helena could play that such and such could play this and then there's this young lad who's gonna play that and I just left a picture of my face and my very short CV which was like doing The Wizard of Oz in year six that was on the final page so the idea being that she'd finish the book and she'd go but this is great but who's going to play the young lad I don't think she did I know she didn't because I've since become a friend of hers but she sent me that note and I've kept ever since it says Dear Josh thank you for the book good luck Hannah Montana it's just quite a nice
GQ Videoseries,are these face rolling devices Petra who makes me look really nice and normal hopefully when I do things like this used these recently in can and they were actually Lush they're so nice and you just pop them on your face and roll them about and yeah you put them in the fridge they're nice and cold and I'm telling you now if you've got hay fever or anything like that these are great some of my Ceramics they're essential because I really like them this is a ceramic by my grandmother I love it very much and my grandmother passed away a couple of years ago and she was an incredible woman and I was left this and it's very beautiful and I've got to figure out how to hang it but at the moment it's sort of rested at home but I really love it and I actually love the wood that it's attached to I think it's very handsome
GQ Videoseries,so then the next one this is a very brilliant British ceramicist called Ian Godfrey and this is one of his cityscapes it's actually a lidded vessel so you can see it's sort of like six escapes and you've got these animals but if you open it up you get a little treat with these birds that sit inside I love it very much and now this is very important because it was given to me by my friend Jonathan it's by an artist called Lucy Rhee who's perhaps one of the most celebrated ceramicists I'm not a big collector of things so I'm in no way looking to collect a load of stuff I just like the idea of looking after these precious objects and they're just nice to look at on me my
GQ Videoseries,is matcha Leaf a tree memory game very simple concept you get a load of trees like here we have beech tree here then you have the leaf thereof of the beech tree so you put them all the cards over like this and scatter them around there's loads of them so you go Beach tree and then you've got this memory games you've got to remember where the leaf of the beach tree is there's the leaf of the beech tree and I appreciate it sounds very basic and perhaps tedious but if you like trees like me it's not it's really enjoyable these running shoes oh here we go adizer adios Pro threes they're extremely light and I don't know if you'll be able to see in this light but they're kind of like see almost see through it it's like a I don't know what the material is they're amazing but anyway they're essential because I use them to go running and I actually ran the London Marathon for the first time this year in these for a great charity called the Samaritans they're very nice I mean I supposedly they're yeah they're they're race shoes which I guess that means you use them for things like marathons I feel quite cool wearing them actually and that's it thank you very much for watching
GQ Videoseries,hi I'm Ryan Gosling if you're a Ken or you're Ken curious or you're just confused like I was you're in my top 10 Ken centrals to help you tap into your kennergy  headband preferably lightning the headband is important for Form and Function it differentiates between good can and bad can when you put it on it sends a clear signal that it's go time but it's essential that someone see you put it on and preferably they see you put it on from behind too this motion is important you can also achieve this with a ball cap you sort of start brim first eyes cast and Shadow mysterious and then you pick the moment and when it is go time you reverse it now you're a loose cannon ready to fire sunglasses Ken's got to have at least two pairs at all times you want the first pair to be something that Barbie would also wear she needs them for whatever reason you have them at the ready dark ones are great because they can hide your sadness you never want to risk bumming Barbie out that's also why you have a second pair Nat or mirrored so you can reflect Barbie's greatness because that's really your job you know and she can use them to put on lipstick while you hide your sadness so two pairs of sunglasses clutch [Applause] can in a box this is to remind you of the box that you came in and the box that the world will happily put you back in if you don't count as hard as you can every day pretty outfit and just a reminder of what you do if you forget he does Beach watches generally the watch is a symbol that you're busy and you have important things to do and cool places to be when you're a Ken you have none of those things so cool so it's even more important for you to appear that you do I'm sure you're all aware of the Coco Chanel rule before you leave the house you take one
GQ Videoseries,off the Ken rule is you put three things on this I use for real world time this is Barbie land time and then I have this one because it tracks the moon's phases so you can keep track of the morning waves  foreign books are important unfortunately I just have book but if you had more than one you would have books books are better preferably ones about horses what can I say books make people think that you have interests and Ken's number one personality trait is just to look interested in things not be interesting don't make that mistake okay that is a slippery slope just look interested and books are great for that because you can open them at any time at any time you can just  and look interested interesting thanks Mike Ken okay surfboard and let me just start this off by saying my Ken's job is Beach I'm not surf Ken I'm Beach Ken and I'm not claiming to be a surf cam so I don't want any surfkins kind of trolling me in the comment section okay I'm not claiming to have any of this sort of spirituality that comes with surfing any of that Insight I'm just using it for scale because when you're a human sized kin that's very important and so you need a human size surfboard to communicate that scale and you can hold it and I've also found that you can also lean  rollerblades this is pretty self-explanatory my Ken's Barbie likes to rollerblade so he literally goes nowhere without them did you bring your rollerblades I literally go nowhere without them can underwear look it's just important to have your name written on your underwear for lots of reasons I'm sure your mother's told you that but most importantly it keeps your name in the mix if you wear them high it just keeps your name out there it's easy to get lost in the shuffle and it's also good because then if Barbie ever says hey is that Ken written on your underwear you can say underwear and that's all you want you just want to share a moment with Barbie a foam ink if you can't Define Yourself by your thoughts or experiences or accomplishments the filming can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you you don't need any of that because you're the Canon the foam Inc oh I'm happy did you know thank you for noticing that it's a horse line the Ken fanny pack cool
GQ Videoseries,about this is that you can have your name written on it in Metallica font what's even cooler about this is that you can have Barbie's Essentials inside of one of your Essentials I think it's good to have a pink mic on hand you want to toast Barbie accomplishments of which there are many all the time every good Barbie hype man has the pink mic you know a hanky just in case she breaks a sweat I've never seen that happen you prepare for the worst and you hope for the best and then you know you kind of have like a statement necklace you know who knows maybe one day you'll get the baddest Barbie in the game to wear your chain so that's my top 10 Ken Essentials just remember that behind every great Barbie there's a Ken it's totally fine with that hopefully he's right behind her in case she needs anything because she deserves it because she's Barbie and he's totally fine with that forever
GQ Videoseries,is other than a really beat up up looking teddy bear I mean look at this
GQ Videoseries,why would you not want this what's up GQ I'm Aaron Paul and these are my 10 Essentials my favorite prop that I own from Breaking Bad this pink teddy bear was introduced in the first episode of the second season it kind of just kind of popped up throughout the entire second season and it quickly became my favorite prop that I wanted to steal they wouldn't let me steal it but Vince Gilligan our fearless leader of the show knew that this was my favorite one and when we wrap the Series Vince surprised me with this This Charming little guy once I got my eye on this pink teddy bear in the second season I realized that I was gonna try to steal a lot of from that show I won't talk about what I stole because I don't want Sony and AMC to know that I have it sorry a pair of car keys why they're essential is this car I actually picked up on my very first date with my wife Lauren you know we met at a music festival we had our first kiss on a ferris wheel you know I started telling her that night that I was gonna marry her one day I was obsessed I hit her up and asked her if she wanted to meet me in Vegas for a dinner and a show keep it innocent and then the next day pick up a car and uh drive it back and so we went had the best night of our Lives we won 16 Grand at the blackjack table we then jumped into a cab told the cab driver to take us to the nearest Chapel to get married you know you think you're in Vegas it's Saturday night it's not too late you think these chapels are always open but we try to open up the doors and the doors are locked we decided maybe this was uh not in the cards for us that night anyways these car keys sort of represent our first aid and the love that we have for each other we just celebrated our 10 years of marriage to be super cheesy I just decided to see if I could get a right personalized plate for the car the first
GQ Videoseries,I I typed in was I love you and that was available that just shows you the world that we're living in like I just I can't believe that that was a available so if you see a little blue Cobra driving around with the license plate that says I love you now it's true foreign okay so this next
GQ Videoseries,is actually a pair of meteorites and so it starts with this one this was a gift from my wife we're always looking up in the Stars you know we would just open up a bottle of wine and talk for hours while just staring up at the universe anyways one of my roommates at the time he was convinced that 2012 was the end because he was convinced that well at the end of the Mayan calendar we're gonna die I'm like you were out of your mind and so I decided to make him start believing that meteorites were slamming into our backyard in North Hollywood and it started with this one I had dug like a little crater and I put this inside of it and I put a bunch of dirt around the crater so it looked like you know it caused like an impact very Amateur hour by the way and he's like what is this and he pulls it out and he's like I knew it this is a meteorite these things are hitting the ground I'm telling you the world is ending and it's gonna this is how it's gonna end I'm like oh my God it's working like way better than I had anticipated I had to level up you know I had to go to the meteorite shop in Santa Monica I spent way too much money on this
GQ Videoseries,cut two just you know like a couple weeks later I dig a giant crater I come up with this contraption that made a very loud noise in the backyard he comes running out out of his bedroom and his boxers he then of course starts losing his mind again he's like I told you to his girlfriend they start getting in an argument cut two I'm not joking cut two about a week later I'm watching a Giants football game it goes to the local news there was footage in my backyard that was shot by my buddy's girlfriend she brought it to the news and she claimed it happened in her backyard and it made the six o'clock news and the 11 o'clock news fake news people fake news  Okay so this next
GQ Videoseries,uh was a gift from my wife it's from Tom York who's the singer of Radiohead and the reason why she gave me this is I did a fundraiser for her non-profit called kind campaign that coincided with the finale of Breaking Bad I wanted to do an event for the the public so they could be invited and watch the series finale with the entire cast and crew and we did that and we raised about 1.6 million dollars for kind campaigning kind campaign you know my wife started years and years and years ago she travels the country who talks to young girls about the effects of bullying within their school hallways so she wanted to present me with something that she knew I would really love and so she Tracked Down Tom he wrote some of the lyrics to one of my favorite songs Fake Plastic Trees and turn it into like a little art piece and then at the top it says this is especially for Aaron and a cost a million dollars 1.6 million dollars to uh be precise but who's counting this is a bracelet that my daughter actually just made me for Father's Day she's five years old and when she sits down she really sits down and focuses on things that she wants to sort of accomplish and she just loves her mommy and daddy and her brothers so much she constantly makes me things colors me things she's just such a talented young lady and I'm obsessed with her story I love you baby thank you please keep making me bracelets okay um oh to keep it in the theme of children this essential is the very first toy I bought my daughter after she was born she instantly fell in love with it it was constantly in her mouth we kind of nicknamed her bubbles because she just constantly was bubbling drooling on this
GQ Videoseries,definitely a lot of miles but is now on my bookshelf in our little Library this is a beautiful reminder you know my wife married me thinking I did not want to have kids I realized that after playing a father on a series out of New York it was the first time I allowed myself to kind of be in that headspace of becoming a dad it just sort of changed my mind and I remember sitting Lauren down I finally told her that I wanted to have kids and she didn't think she heard me right and she wanted me to repeat myself and so I did and then she just started crying anyways this is a beautiful reminder of how PM that I changed my mind sorry is it getting too heavy in here now we'll get into the lighter things bring out the booze foreign  this is bottle one from our very first batch batch one it's a company that my friend Brian Cranston and I started it it sort of represents the relationship that Brian and I uh have he quickly became one of my closest friends in the world when I started shooting breaking bad he became my mentor I have just learned so much from this man on screen and off I just love the man I mean he's my son's Godfather we're very very close and when we were trying to figure out the name for the company we just couldn't beat dos Hombres it's just simple two guys you know we're Blue Collar background both him and I grew up with really no money in our pockets it's about kind of two guys showing up going to work to be honest we haven't made a single penny off of this company we only Hemorrhage money into the company we know how to do business people um but we're very proud of what we're doing so um if you like Mezcal drink some books I think it's very important for people to read I think it feeds the soul these three books were written from one of my favorite authors who also happens to be one of my best friends in the world Jedediah Jenkins this first book is called to shake the sleeping self he decided that he wanted to ride a bike from the Oregon coast to the tip of Patagonia and he did it in a year and a half he started at the exact spot that his parents ended their Journey Across America he is a proud beautiful gay man that when he started this journey he didn't really know or understand his sort of place in life because he grew up in a very religious household and his mother just was not having it leads me to his third book that is just about two this book is also amazing but I'm just now starting this book it's not out yet but it follows a journey between him and his mother Across America in a car trying to see if they can survive their own differences and I just started it and it's just so beautiful I'm just so proud of this guy so I had to bring it my Leica Q2 I would not consider myself a photographer by any means I'm not pretending to be one but I needed a nice camera once I started having babies this
GQ Videoseries,comes with me uh everywhere that my kids are I'm obsessed with them and also encourages me to print out photos I don't like having things just kind of live on my phone or in the cloud I like to take photos and try to print out as many as possible I do autofocus you know there you go oh my God I missed you there you go perfect yeah it's great and it just makes you look like you know what you're doing yeah this next
GQ Videoseries,is a candle I burn too many candles there's candles burning and pretty much every room of my house I travel with candles I always travel with candles and music it's just a must for me typically it is a diptyque and so I always go in there and come out with an embarrassing amount of bags my wife she makes fun of me constantly but  all right G Cube that's it thank you so much for watching foreign
GQ Videoseries,good God I swear I'm not as cool as some other people I know some people get on they're like I have a guitar that I bring everywhere I bring my dog I don't have any of that stuff I have a pen I have an inhaler I live my life hey what's up GQ I'm Jacksepticeye and these are my essentials this is Throat Coat tea or as I like to call it the throat goat that's what they call me yeah he got it I got put on this from I did a tour with the game grumps it's a 2017 maybe and I had never heard of it before but to kind of like keep your voice nice supports throat health so it kind of like coats your throat as it's cold keeps your voice nice if you're talking all the time but especially when traveling because when I travel I tend to get sick you Americans love your air conditioning and it's dry everywhere how most of you don't have a sore throat all the time I don't know every time I come here I wake up and it feels like I swallowed glass foreign this is my uh my ventolin 100 micrograms salbutamol sulfate yeah shout out illness I have asthma so I have an inhaler with me all the time I also have like a steroid one that I take uh during the winter because the winter months are hard on us little baby Longs so I had this one that I take like all the time when I was a kid I used to take this twice in the morning twice at night and then a brown inhaler I don't know what was in it I turned 18 and they were like you weren't supposed to be taking that that much and then I was like oh and they're like yeah you don't really have asthma anymore I was like I did it I beat the system and then a couple of years ago I started getting Wheezy again because I guess I'm getting on in years the wheels are coming off so I had to go back on my inhalers I'll give you a little demonstration  oh that's it foreign  but it has an e at the end so is it Moleskine they're just weird they're European this is my notepad or one of Manny that I bring with me every now and then I'll get an idea for something if it's a video or I'm trying to do stuff with this like whole universe of characters that I'm doing and I I like having a notepad with me to write stuff down because I I could do it on my laptop but I don't like doing that I like writing it out I like having like a pen and paper because I feel like it like gets in my brain more or I like work it out more that way if I'm writing it on my laptop I tend to forget about it and I hate having a messy desktop so it just gets shoved away in a folder somewhere so I like having a notepad to write ideas down at the start of this one has like if I did a new tour what would it look like and it's like anytime I have any sort of idea I just pop out my pan on my notepad and I write it down and more often than not they never come to fruition but I just like having a notepad I I every time I go to a store I like a stationary store I'm like I want to get a notepad I I have nothing to write in it and I have like five at home that aren't even filled yet but I like having it I also write like games into this if somebody gives me a recommendation I'll write down like oh I should play this and play this and then kind of like write out why I should play and things like that so I don't know I'm a very disorganized person normally but this is like some semblance of organization in it somewhere I guess  this is my laptop which is a new Macbook Air MacBook and something I don't know I bought it new and I really like it because I used to have an old one that was much bigger and bulkier and because I traveled so much I always need something to just do work I do thumbnails on this I edit videos I get stuff ready for my content and sometimes I just watch movies on it or shows so I bring this everywhere with me whenever I travel and I love how small it is because now it's tiny and it's really light and the one I had before was Stronger but it was so bulky that I hated carrying it it gave me a headache every time I put it in my bag so this one is Tiny and I love it I could just sit here and my videos are actually up on it right now you can see my whole Channel ready to go because I needed to get videos ready for today so I was using it this morning uh these are my headphones Apple airpod Maxes I really like these because the noise cancellation of them is really good I used to have a set of Sony headphones that I used all the time but their new ones are not as comfy and I wanted to try these out and these have probably the best sound for any of the headphones that I've tried like Bluetooth travel headphones because we're on the airplane a lot and we're traveling quite a bit I I like having headphones that have noise canceling in them but they're quite heavy so I they're not really for everybody but they they are some of the comfier ones that I've used people in the headphone space are quite particular about the headphones that they use so I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry if there's better ones out there that I haven't used this is all I know okay it's either I'm listening to stuff on my computer or my phone if I'm watching a TV show or a movie or I listen to some podcasts but sometimes music on the way here this time I was re-listening to Lincoln Park's Hybrid Theory and Meteora because I got the 20th anniversary edition the like 200 one and I was so hyped about that and it came about like all the vinyls and the discs and the artwork and everything and I was like well I can't listen to that on the plane so I I was listening to those albums again and it brought me back to my childhood  for Apple at this point look it's it's a convenient ecosystem that works well uh this is my phone the iPhone 14 pro I guess this one is under someone at my door my ring doorbell is going off so whoever that is hopefully it's someone that's not supposed to be there I said an Essentials video if they don't bring up a phone then I don't trust them everyone has a phone it's like who are you contacting with some people come in it's like no I bring my my dream catcher with me or something like yeah sure you do everyone brings a phone with them everyone needs to be in contact with the world at all times so I feel like this is like the one essential is this like the one
GQ Videoseries,that everybody says they bring pretty much across the board yeah this is like the one common denominator of humanity right now I don't know if that's a good or a bad
GQ Videoseries,but I mean why wouldn't you have a phone I need to go on socials with it I need to check my videos I need to contact people here and whenever I'm traveling if I don't have a phone I'm lost what else am I gonna do this is very different all the other ones are like nice and cool and it's like wow what a cool personality he has this is just moisturizer this is Cetaphil Pro oil control moisturizer with SPF 30 in it because I get I get an oily T-Zone you know you're still watching right you're still listening I never had like a skincare routine for my whole life which I probably should have had I feel like everyone should have some sort of care for their skin because whenever people look at like Paul Rudd and they're like why does he look like a baby still it's probably because he uses something like this every single day I remember watching tick tocks of like ever seen those ones with like the dermatologists and they're talking about stuff that you should do for your skin and there's like peptides there's vitamin C boosters there's retinols and I do use all of those as well I have like a vitamin C booster that I do in the mornings and then I moisturize and then at night I have a retinol night cream that I use that's why this baby face has stayed pristine for years the one common
GQ Videoseries,that they kept saying was that no matter where you go you can live without that stuff but you should always have an SPF moisturizer with you because my skin gets really dry after a shower and even if you don't have sunshine in your life like England and Ireland don't have you should always still have an SPF on you whatever you're doing because that's how your skin stays youthful and exuberant and I'm here for the Long Haul baby I want to make in videos in my 60s and I'm going to still look the same I'll just have longer grayer hair precise V5 RT pilot pen again because I write so much all the time this is brand new as well this is because my other one ran out this is one that was recommended by a friend again because I have a notepad with me everywhere I go and I want to write stuff down I I hate my own handwriting and I normally hate writing my hand gets tired all the time but for somebody in this pen Glides like a dream baby you know how people are like what you got you got a V8 in that bad boy yeah you got a car you got a V8 engine twin turbos like no I got a precise V5 baby this is gonna take us to the Moon can I get a whoop whoop this is my whoop watch which I recently got into in the last like six months and I love it because I used to have a Fitbit and I didn't really like the app how that one works I used to have uh an Apple Watch but I hated how distracting the screen was all the time because I I'm a monkey's banging symbols in here and every time something would show up I'd be like what's that and then people I was around would be like oh you need to be somewhere I'm like no I've just I just have I have ADHD I need to like look at everything that pops up and most times it was like oh someone's at your door giving you spam mail but I got the whoop watch because I watched another YouTuber podcaster named Cody Co he was sponsored by woop at one point and he showed off some of it and I was like dude that looks exactly like what I want and I love it because it's all in the app and the app is so straightforward and it tells me how much I've slept what my recovery is like can you pass me my phone let's see what my recovery for today is shall we I have 81 recovery and I got 87 of my sleep 7 hours and 11 minutes and my health model monitor I'm all in the green baby my heart rate variance is at 54 milliseconds my heart rate's at 62 bpms right now I thought that would be higher  another
GQ Videoseries,I use all the time is I have earphones at home that are like noise canceling sleep earphones called the Bose sleep buds because I'm so sensitive to noise when I sleep that I I need like something going on in the background at all times something to quell the noise if I'm ever somewhere where there's like cars honking outside or something I put those in and then I play rain sounds on them and then that puts me to sleep real quick and I think I've like pavloved my way into falling asleep quicker with them because now I put them in and my brain hears rain and it's like oh it's sleepy time let's do that so now I actually go to sleep quicker than I ever have in my entire life because I use those and then the world could be ending around me and I will have no idea  well those are my essentials uh some of you might relate very heavily to them some of you might not some of you might think I'm a raving lunatic who cares it's my essentials not yours what are yours okay oh I need my teddy my toy thank you guys for watching thank you for having me this has been very fun those are my essentials I'm jacksepticeye signing off bye bye

GQ Videoseries,I do a joke I do a bit in my stand-up that I say I wish my girlfriend makes me Bento boxes and now she does so sometimes you just have to Badger someone with stand up until they do something what's up GQ it's Jimmy o Yang and these are my essentials  one of my essentials is this matcha set I bring it everywhere with me to set at home anywhere we travel to because I don't really drink coffee it gets me too great I have multiples of these at home when I travel I take one of my trailer and I make myself a fresh matcha every morning it gets a little bit of caffeine but it's also a nice meditative
GQ Videoseries,to do to whisk it I don't drink coffee it gets me too jittery I feel like I can't get into my character a lot of times when I drink coffee and I can't sleep at night so matcha is an absolute essential for me and everywhere I go I always ask for a cup of hot water whether it's from crafty whatever now I'm like kind of doing what my mom does like she'll go to Olive Garden and ask for a glass of hot water I don't know how older Asian people especially do it like piping hot 120 degree water just like just chugging it right just mouth of Steel my temp is about 80 85 Max I would say foreign  this is one of my favorite Essentials it's my bentho box set that my girlfriend got for me she lovingly packs me a lunch every day because on set with catering sometimes the food is a little heavy it's kind of a bit of a crap shoot so let's see what we have in here oh we got some crab fried rice here today I think this is soup the shrimp tom yum soup I mean come on guys you don't get this on set this is absolutely essential to have a good meal that's not too heavy and it's also portion control because if there's food in front of me I'm gonna eat it so if there's a whole catering portion of food I'm gonna eat all of it and then after lunch I just would not be able to perform the bento box is totally essential and one of my essentials that I'm already wearing is this these shoes that I discovered they're like tiny little rain boots that doesn't have a whole boot um they just rubber shoes I love gardening with them at first me and my girlfriend both bought a pair and also we wear the same shoe size so we're very blessed that we can just interchange our shoes yeah these are beautiful look at the color it's by this brand called CVS we just saw it at a store in Santa Barbara when we're like in the midst of wine tasting so this was definitely like a drunken purchase but it has been the best pair of shoes so far it's better than any slides it's like a real pair of shoes it's comfortable with driving good for the rain and started what as gardening shoes and now I just wear it everywhere even for a GQ interview and from my emotional support essential I got this guy my tato potato squeezy tato look at this it's a stress relief potato and it's just super cute I think Japanese
GQ Videoseries,called tato his name is t-a-y-t-o-teto so I've been collecting a lot of different tato things this like my Hello Kitty is super cute and Squishy and whenever you know I'm frustrated or like stressed I just squeeze him a couple times I think everyone should have uh their version of a squishy squeeze a potato look at him he's so cute I anything when your name is already perfect why name you anything his name is just Tato beat that
GQ Videoseries,that I take everywhere with me is this craft gun massage gun I mean there's many Brands out there particularly love this because it's a smaller startup I actually waited like three months on a Kickstarter to get this
GQ Videoseries,it's really cool it switches and it's really powerful and just after a tough day um you know whether it's doing stand up or in this new show I'm doing I might have a couple fight scenes for you guys you gotta get your body right you know it just feels really good this one has a good reach you can go behind we also have a smaller theragon like the baby travel size one that my girlfriend loves uh because this one's a little too intense I honestly it's so powerful I only have it on the first setting I never get it on the third setting it just kind of like too crazy but it's it's definitely one of my essentials to keep my body right for the rare times that I do work out yeah my tightest spot on my body is my shoulder blade so I want to make sure I get a gun that's long enough and it has good enough reach to hit that ah you see like it's just like it's like pounding cement it's so stiff and hard on that part that is probably doing some spinal damage to me I'm not sure you know a lot of times um after I do a Big Show and stand up or even after I wake up from like a stressful night I always have to tell myself to relax my jaws you know like I feel like I'm always like clenching my jaw and and I didn't realize how much stress I had on it so maybe they should start making one of these that's small enough just a baby one for your face and job you know yeah I think they call that a vibrator I think everyone should have one of these in a household it's a PayPal it's something I grew up with in Hong Kong it's like a throat coding medicine syrup it's a lot of herbs in it it's actually great for voiceovers one of my favorite actors friends and one of the most brilliant voiceover actors my friend Ben Schwartz he's the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog I've always had this in my house right but he was the one that told me to take it before and after voiceover jobs so the word has gone now outside the Chinese Community into the voiceover community and now hopefully to the world and the Fashion World in GQ tune foreign cough suppressant and dispersing of mucus that was actually a commercial in Hong Kong oh yeah it rhymes Flonase I need it every day uh just a couple Spritz inside the nostrils got me feeling right you know what I mean I actually used to get a lot of strep throat a lot of sore throats and I went to an ear nose and throat doctor even as an adult when I was like 30 years old like maybe I need my tonsils out and he was like that's the procedure I should really avoid how about just try flonazing for two three months straight don't skip a day don't only Flonase when you need it Flonase every day and then all my sore throats went away and this is not a commercial for big Pharma this is just something that works for me we need medical disclaimers don't don't let a comedian tell you to use Flonase interesting I think growing up in Hong Kong and China allergy wasn't a big concept and now coming to America I'm like oh a lot of my ailments were just allergies you know but I don't know I don't know which culture is actually correct because now you have people that are deathly ill with a flu and they're just like Oh no just just allergies man I'm totally cool being at this party so I don't trust that either this is one of my essentials what is it it's a drink it's called in Mandarin and it's literally a dollar for this whole pack and if you open it there's these little packs and then you can make a little tea it's a little sweet herbal tea uh it doesn't have any caffeine or anything I don't think there's hot and cold you know in Chinese culture this is more cooling so if you eat too much fried food too much hot sauce you want some of this to cool you down so this is what I do after lunch to me it's almost like a Chinese Digestive and it's better than you know drinking coffee or drinking another tea too much caffeine after lunch so sometimes I mix this with a little ginseng and that gives me the energy but this is just a nice chill drink you pour in some hot water and it mixes it it's pretty cool and I think it's good for you not sure and to go with my Bento meals it's very essential to have a good hot sauce I actually have a collection of hot sauce in my trailer when I shoot I have some Italian turoni peppers I have the Lao ganma the Chinese chili oil and this is one of my recent favorites it's the queen Majesty Scotch bonnet Ginger hot sauce has a really good kick with the Scotch bonnet but also very sophisticated and goes well with everything chicken fish Asian food American food big favorite I think it helps my performance to feel like I'm not at work and I'm at home and I'm comfortable and I'm in my body right like it's I guess very actor talk but at the same time one time I brought this Trinidadian scorpion sauce to work just for fun it's delicious and I put on some chicken that Bree made me and it was so hot completely ruined my whole face of makeup I was sweating they have to redo my hair and makeup for like another 30 minutes so don't do that know your limits and another one of my essentials is this it's a hand sanitizer it looks like a little credit card it's this brand no shinku we got in the gifting bag once and now me and my girlfriend loves it smells great it almost smells like perfume this one's actually out how embarrassing that's how much I use it but it's like a wallet size hand sanitizer and you just Spritz it on here and it just you gotta just trust me it smells really good I used to use some hand sanitizer before covet because it's just easier than washing your hands at times but ever since covet I have like an assortment of hand sanitizers in my house but this is definitely the most classy coolest and best smelling one yeah it comes in a lot different scents this one's called vetiver I also don't know why I said it in like a French accent like it's probably just like vetiver no Shinko if you're listening to this uh send me some more send me a box I need this it's kind of expensive I think oh oh wait a minute it's coming back to life perfume it's beautiful big fan thanks GQ and these are my essentials thank you for tuning in and repeat

up we got my keyboard and mouse and this is for my gaming for those who don't know I started off my whole YouTube career through gaming I joined FaZe Clan in 2012 which they're the biggest gaming organization in the world so I actually used to use a controller but I recently switched over to mouse and keyboard because I don't play Call of Duty anymore I played cod with a controller but now I switched over to my favorite game of all time Counter-Strike CS go I'm a beast at CS a lot of people think I don't game anymore because I don't post it but I mean once a gamer always a gamer it's always in my blood so this is called an extra five mic and it just feels so good for Counter-Strike in specific it's crazy some people I see put their keyboard like this and they like angle their chair in a way and they play like this but I can't do that I just put my keyboard like this and with the op I flick oh yeah this is it so I film a lot of YouTube videos and I post three times a week and this is the main camera I use a lot of my supporters actually ask what I use and they're curious about it so this is the Sony a7s3 and for the lens that I use is a 16 to 35 and once I transition from gaming to vlogging I got a camera that a lot of people might be familiar with it's called the Canon g7x if you want to make a channel and you do want to upgrade to like one of the best this is what I use and I personally think the quality on my videos are A1  this next essential is my supporters and what I have in my hand right here is actually a book made by one of my biggest fans his name is Caesar Solis and it's just so beautiful I look at this every time I just feel down I feel like I I stress out a lot sometimes and and my fans give me Comfort and as you can see it's like a lot of photos of me old pictures my entire family right there there's like some of the the thank you messages from my fans here's one from Caesar here's one from astonishing awadis AKA Cassandra I'm just extremely grateful for the position I'm in and I sometimes get emotional thinking about how many people I Inspire every day and it literally just means the world to me every time I meet a fan or see a nice comment every day so thank you to everyone out there who supports me it's just what I dreamed about as a kid and the fact that it became a reality I would never let anything change that my mom wanted me to go to college so I went to Community College for two weeks and I was like I can't focus on YouTube and college at the same time so I asked my mom if I could take a six month break and she said yes still to this day from eight nine years ago I still read almost all my comments it's unbelievable I know it's hard to keep up with a lot but I do try to read comments as much as I can  this next essential is my G fuel energy drink called chug rug we got the inspiration from fortnite it was back in 2018 when fortnite was extremely big and I was into it and I was like what could we make that looks blue and cool like chug jug from fortnite and I'm like my name is rug chug rug oh my god I didn't even mention I'm on the can guys this is why it's so special to me as well it's me holding my hoodie like this and throwing up phase up  potential is important to me it is a speaker I can't live without this my top artist of all time is Drake and I know that's kind of basic but I do have a giant picture of Drake in my house like not on some like creepy fan stuff like I just he's inspired me so much and I just love his music like I feel like he doesn't miss so Drake is up there I listen to 21 Travis Scott Lil Uzi Bad Bunny too I don't really speak Spanish but I just vibe to his music a lot I've actually made one song and it's called going live and I actually made it just for a YouTube video I was just like hey like we need a video idea so let's just hit the studio a lot of YouTubers are making songs and I didn't take it serious whatsoever but the song actually did come out pretty good and it's I think my most viewed video on my YouTube channel of 10 years now  my next essential is pretty unique this was a gift by my best friend Noah it's an essential oil and I personally love scents I love cologne I love candles I just love smelling good yo what's good bro I'm in the middle I'm in the middle of the GQ shoot right now all cameras on me they can hear you um do you remember what like scents are in this essential oil that you got me I smell the vanilla little extracts in there and um a lot of love that's all I needed to hear it's made with a lot of love but it really does smell fire  this next essential is my new brand that I just launched called one up candy there wasn't that one candy that was extremely sour to me I know Warheads are sour I know toxic waste is sour but I wanted to make something a little bit more sour so these are the neutralizer packets which come in handy with this challenge you take the neutralizer packet and you pour it in six to eight ounce of water bottle and what the neutralizer does is after the challenge when you have that sour stuff in your mouth it actually just takes it all away it's it's like magic I call it magic potion so we're gonna shake it up so you take three gummies and the objective of the challenge is to try not to make a face in 30 seconds I guess here I go again I've done this like 10 times and I have still yet to succeed oh my God did I make a face I already I made one yeah oh my God that hit me right away sometimes the longest I've lasted was 15 seconds that was five seconds bro foreign I got put on to reading books by my therapist a few years ago I was going through a little bit of a hard time and he gave me this book called code to Joy and it's the four-step solution to unlocking your natural state of happiness and he's one of the authors actually it genuinely just helped my mental a lot especially when I was going through a tough time and from then I wanted to start reading more books so I got The Four Agreements gifted to me which is awesome for your mental strength and this one was gifted to me by my manager Nick shout out Nick back there he surprised me with the Mamba mentality book and although this is mainly about basketball it's the way he viewed his opponents the way he played basketball it honestly still has a very powerful mental message like the Mamba mentality anytime I'm stressed or like if I'm like nervous about something I'm not gonna lie I was nervous before this GQ interview I mean you guys have had some of like the top A-list celebrities sitting in this chair so I'm very grateful to be here I just think about this I think about that like mental strength that I should have different things will help different people out but definitely don't be afraid to reach out to anyone uh friends family teachers whoever it is that you can contact like just don't be afraid use your voice and let people know how you feel you're not a burden to anybody  my last and final essential that I keep in my wallet every single day is a picture of my entire family I am very close to my family just a little back story my parents moved from Iraq um knowing very little English my dad found a job at a liquor store and he just grinded grinded grinded and worked so many hours and he was able to buy his own liquor store after so many years so back in 2017 or 2018 I was finally in a great position to where I could retire my dad from work and it was like one of the craziest full circle moments of all time because my dad took extremely good care of me and the fact that I was in a position to take care of him uh it just felt amazing I I just felt super blessed but even to this day six years later after I retired him he still goes to the store like three four times a week still Gets behind the counter my parents they didn't want me to do tube they actually just wanted me to go to school but I just had this like feeling I just I knew what I loved back then in high school and it was gaming I had a huge passion for gaming again never left me but I just continued to grind and I got one of my first checks was a which was about like twenty five hundred dollars and uh my parents just thought it was fake they thought it wasn't real money because like it went through PayPal I got one of my bigger checks and pulled money out of the bank and gave money to my parents I'm like guys it's real I'm not going to jail I'm just making YouTube videos and I had to sit down and walk them through like the whole process who's paying me can I call my mom because I feel like she would be super hyped hi Mom hey um we're filming right now she gets like nervous on camera and stuff but mom you look beautiful I just wanted to say thank you for the life

GQ Videoseries,I mean are people normally doing like face cream and stuff like that is this really heavy hey I'm Jeremy Strong they do a
GQ Videoseries,called 10 essential items I've clearly broken that assignment there's more than 10 things here these are all very important artifacts from my life that I'm sharing with you  this is from season two this is a letter that I ripped up at a press conference if you've seen the show you probably know what that moment was oh this is from season one this is Kendall I don't know if you can see it this was on my suit after I had gone into the water at the end of season one at my sister's wedding that was a really harrowing difficult
GQ Videoseries,I've kept from that from That season this I love as you can see I sort of already have my own version of it I wanted something for Kendall's birthday in season three that felt colossal Rasheed Johnson is an artist that I've admired and I saw that he had collaborated with Liz swigg based on a series of paintings that he made called the anxious man paintings would this was like a keystone that made everything come together for me this is also from my birthday party I seem to make a drink stirrer with my face on it like 3D printed with a crown so they did the end of season three we're in Italy and every time you do a movie or every time I do a season of this there's always a scene that you read that you think I can't do I can't do this and I don't know how I'm gonna do this and I just remember being in that sort of trance in this room before we shot that scene and the feeling of peril this was on the door in that room and and and I guess I looked at it because part of what you have to do as an actor is get out of your way and so I looked at it and it was kind of just telling me something about don't disturb like yourself and surrender to the uncertainty and the unknown but that was a tough day you know the scene didn't go well for like nine or ten takes and then on the next take I sat down on the ground which I hadn't done before and that's what's in the show and that's but that was just a result of giving up and sort of coming face to face with my own in a sense uh limits this is pretty self-explanatory this is a script binder that Robert Duvalle gave me so it's just something that I treasure I went down to visit him once at his farm in Virginia and he's got the Godfather scripts in one of these the same same binders same company same stenciling and everything I find this object both a very meaningful given who it came from you know I've learned a lot from him I think he's one of the greatest actors of all time but what's scary about holding this right now is that it is really just at this point the exoskeleton that is going to contain something that I don't know what that
GQ Videoseries,will be next so it's it's sort of a steadying and comforting and reinforcing to have this kind of embracing it and then the
GQ Videoseries,on the inside will be I guess the next risk and attempt at doing something Jacques marimage sunglasses the best company making sunglasses right now jeromege a Frenchman who lives in L.A I have been very deliberate about candle sunglasses and I've worn some of his frames last year and I kind of sent up a flare and reached out to him and asked him if we could collaborate on something for this season so he his frames are made in Japan and and he went there and I pitched him sort of the colorway that I liked and this old model that they didn't make anymore he made me well he made Kendall these sunglasses and Kendall's initials Kendall Logan Roy KLR are written on the inside I have my pair which also say KLR and Kendall's pair so I do know where one ends and where the other begins  so I've never shown this to anyone this is sat on my desk for like over 20 years these are like artifacts from work I've done since my early 20s this cup was from a play that I did called a matter of choice in a storefront on 39th Street and I guess I'll just kind of dump some stuff out this is a cherry bomb from The Trial of Chicago seven I lit as Jerry Rubin in a scene demonstrating how to make a cherry bomb to to the students in a class this is a watch that I wore in the first movie I ever did called Humboldt County wow I mean I haven't touched these things in a long time that's from Molly's game I used to be able to do all kinds of Poker tricks but I can't anymore you forget you know you when you do these things you fill yourself up with all kinds of visceral understanding but also whatever skills you need to do it but they leave you when it's done I don't even know what this is double smearing off rocks this is when Kendall goes off the wagon in Arizona from the end of the first season I called a friend of mine who was recently sober and I said what would you order if if you were going to go off the wagon and so this is from this bar in Arizona first play I did Off-Broadway play called Defiance by John Patrick Shanley I played a marine there was a letter written by a soldier who was in Vietnam that he wrote home to his parents and he ended the letter saying we are all in desperate need of love so that's what this says on here a story about The Velveteen Rabbit that I was going to tell to my kids on succession that we that we shot that didn't make it into the show just an improvised story that I asked Jesse if I could do this is from a Eugene O'Neill play called Huey that I'd seen pachino do I tried to do myself when I was an undergrad in college and so I did I did that play and this is probably the oldest
GQ Videoseries,I have I did this maybe when I was 19. Vinnie Daniels character I played in The Big Short this is all I kept from it you know there's a Stanley Kunitz poem called the layers and he says I have walked through many lives some of them my own so these feel like fragments of lives that I've walked through and this is all that's left of any of them really I mean the truth is these are such a big part of your life and there's a strange finality when they're over they're just over I know they might exist on Celluloid or on TV but I don't go back and watch anything and so I guess I keep little artifacts you know I mean this is the first time I've ever taken them out so I'm not sure to what end but they do kind of take me back to different selves that I've walked through  this is a record of Glenn Gould's recording First Recording he did two recordings of The Goldberg Variations by Bach it's a piece of music that I've Loved for my adult life I listen to it all the time Glenn Gould was a really eccentric individual and he broke all the rules about what was considered appropriate kinds of concert pianist protocol he would hum exclaim and make sounds while he was playing and he said something that I wrote down that I think about sometimes he said that the purpose of art is not a momentary ejection of adrenaline but rather the lifelong construction of a state of Wonder and serenity so that's what I think about when I think about Glenn Gould his piano playing is beautiful and incomparable and ecstatic and probably would be the piece of music I'd want to listen to if I am lucky enough to choose the piece of music I want to listen to at the end I use Music a lot depending on the emotional valence of a scene music can help me enter into a deeper place in myself that I might need to come from so music is at access point for me foreign  delgadio is an incredible artist Illusionist magician who had a one-man show called in and of itself they turned it into a film it's on Hulu I urge everyone to watch it because it's one of the more astonishing things I've ever seen when you go into the show you pick out a card from a wall I am something something that is feels self-identifying at the end of the show he tells each person the hundreds of people in the audience what card they picked the rulatista is a central character in the story that he tells who is essentially someone who played Russian Roulette to great success and was willing to risk everything every time and exist on that precipice of danger Derek in the show talks about himself being the realtista and he sent this to me he said that he'd not sent this to anyone else but he sent this card to me so it was profoundly meaningful to me rilka said that surely all great artists the product of having been in danger this is a person who is willing to endanger himself again and again and again and again foreign this is a book of paintings by Howard Hodgkin who was a famous British painter incredible painter I was in London and I was working and I walked into the National Portrait Gallery and there was an exhibition of this guy's work and I hadn't heard of him what he does is he sort of takes moments in time that were profound moments for him or moments that really struck him in a certain way and then he tries to translate those moments pictorially so he's painting the feeling of moments in time he would also paint over the frame of his paintings behind the Hedge I find them just incredibly moving simple deep moving as an actor that's your palette as well your palette is your own experiences and memories and feelings that you try to bring in an abstract way using someone else's words you float those words on top of an undercurrent of feeling and so something about these paintings just resonated with me foreign I mean this is like a five hour conversation right here so I'm not really sure these are all books that have been really important books to me Alma mahlers Diaries composer herself married to Klimt and Mahler who talks about the dichotomy inside people of what she calls the loving soul and the calculating soul and her belief was these creators that were in her life these great creators of the 20th century made work of real value when they were operating from the loving soul rather than the calculating Soul it's a great book spectator bird Wallace stegner takes place in Denmark which is a place that I now live but I read this before it I even knew where it was on a map I think he talks about the pain in every choice when we're younger we're in this life of sort of infinite possibility but I think to become an adult is to collapse choices to make choices and to lose that sense of infinite possibility Robert Johnson this is sort of jungian dream work stuff about the Shadow the part of ourselves that we've disavowed but is still there always there that's a big part of Kendall that's been a lot of the subtext of the show my favorite play uh the caretaker by Harold Pinter Incredible Book on acting probably the if I could pick one book on acting for if a young actor was like what should I read I would say this book John cabotzin he is a remarkable man who is a mindfulness teacher MIT trained scientist he created something called mindfulness-based stress reduction I've gone on some Retreats silent Retreats with him four quartets by T.S Eliot when I was 18 went to the Royal Academy of dramatic art the principal told us all to go out and get this book he said it's the only
GQ Videoseries,you ever need to know about acting I kind of agree there's a line in here about a condition of complete Simplicity costing not less than everything um I've already quoted this dude Bruce In Search of Lost time you know I spent a couple years in my early 20s like working in room service and waiting tables and these books kind of saved me because I would you know I didn't have much of a social life I didn't have any money there's so much of what anyone would hope to learn about life contained in these volumes and then number one for me is my struggle uh by Carl Knaus guard Norwegian writer contemporary Norwegian writer it's the most honest expression of life that I've ever read anywhere he writes in this incredibly granular way he'll spend 40 pages talking about taking his four-year-old daughter like to a party and the shoes that she wants to wear and the effect of it the accumulative effect of it by being in such granular detail of life is you see the Beauty and the sacredness in in those small moments and you realize that there are no small moments that's my fast version of these books
GQ Videoseries,I literally shower myself in perfume would you like to see okay I like to get here here armpit armpit wrist spread and then maybe sometimes like the back your ankles and that's it but maybe not hey GQ it's Sydney Sweeney and these are my essentials  one of my essentials sugar this is my breakfast this is my lunch and this is my dinner I live and Breathe by Sugar everyone who is close to me knows that I will get through the day if I have a good candy in my purse or if someone else hands me some sugar so I always have some good backup this is the Holy Grail of sugar car ride a take five a little breakfast Kit Kat a good popcorn mix I'll pour my Sour Patch Kids in my popcorn bowl so that when I'm eating my popcorn and watching a movie I'll get a little surprise AirHeads for fun and nerds because I always forget about nerds I always travel with disposable cameras or have it on me or have them piled in my trailer or at parties I think that they're just such a fun way of capturing moments and I like giving them to everybody to capture things that I might not even be able to see I have a little picture book yeah like an old school picture book because I remember growing up and going through my grandma or my mom's little photo albums and I love that and I kind of want to be able to give that to my kids one day instead of just scrolling through a phone so I've been trying to capture more photos and puts together little photo albums so I have that for my family perfume Armani my way I need more I'm almost out I was never like a huge perfume girl growing up because my mom never really introduced me to it and then as I got older I started using it and this has become my scent I love it I love it so much it smells like flowers and I feel like a princess whenever I have it on it's my favorite scent but I literally shower myself in perfume would you like to see okay I like to go here hair armpit armpit wrist spread and then maybe sometimes like the back your ankles and that's it but maybe not I can't see far away so I have to wear glasses and I don't wear contacts which I probably should but I have a fear of putting things in my eye which I'm trying to get over so I'm constantly either wearing my glasses or my eyes are so strained and red because they're just constantly not being able to see so this is a must I didn't start wearing glasses until I was like 17 or 18 years old and the moment I put them on I was like this is what the world looks like look at the trees there's leaves so yeah my glasses they're dirty though my next essential is what I'm currently reading right now and it's Molly Shannon's Memoir I'm like halfway through so far but I'm really enjoying it she sent me the book and I'm really proud of her and you guys should read it it's really good I always have a book with me I try to read a book a week I love reading I grew up loving reading I think I read more books and watch TV I tried getting into like reading on my iPod my eyes I get tired and I have to have a paper book I dream of having like a giant Library one day I'm just trying to collect books as I go I mean my Armani lip power it's the best color this is like the most natural for my lip I think this is 103 right yeah 103. it's the greatest lip color on the market when I'm doing just like natural makeup and no lip liner I'll use this I use it for carpets too because it's just it's super pretty and natural which I like to go for natural the most when it's just me I have one in my makeup bag and then I have one that's in my purse that I'm carrying a day I have a tendency to lose things my Lanai lip sleeping mask it's a must I have one in every bag every vanity every bathroom vanilla is my favorite I'm almost out but I put it on when I sleep but then I also put it on during the day which I hope that's correct I hope I don't get in trouble for that it's pretty good it's pretty good  my next essential is a one one skin eye patch these are everything for me I travel with them I wear them before I go to work before carpets I try to put eye patches on every morning just to wake myself up but these have become my favorite I used to Sting from eye patches and this one just nourishes me the most I hear I'll open it I'll show you it's like this cool jelly material and it's blue which is my favorite color if you'll see it's like kind of jelly see I can't put it on right now because my makeup's done when I wear them on airplanes I'll just wear them the whole flight and then they dry up but my skin doesn't so that's that is key the only drink I drink is water I only drink water the reasoning is really strange when I was like 12 for whatever reason I said I'm only gonna drink water for the rest of my life and I just kind of stuck with it I don't know why I think it was like a challenge I presented to myself and then I kept going with it and I like it because I eat a lot of sugar like a lot of sugar so I think it balances me out I probably go through a good like four to six bottles a day that's good right  so
GQ Videoseries,which I think is everyone's essential as a good iPhone charger I have my European adapter because you never know where I'm gonna wake up in the morning I always have my charger but my phone dies which I kind of like when it dies because then the world is quiet thank you for watching and this is how I get through life

GQ Videoseries,Hola amigos de YouTube Soy Diego calva Y estos son mis 10 objetos esenciales [Música] Pues bueno mi primer objeto esencial son las cartas me encanta jugar juegos todo el tiempo soy alguien muy lúdico y pues para mí el mejor juego que existe es Magic the gadening definitivamente y el segundo y el que me gusta desde que soy chiquito es Pokémon Pues mira no se trata tanto de que haya una carta complicada de encontrar sino de hacer el mejor deck Entonces yo llego haciendo deck toda la vida y cuando salgo de viaje y estoy grabando una película siempre estoy jugando Solo contra mí mismo es un poco ridículo pero pues es lo que me mantiene concentrado con Magic es distinto porque Magic es el juego más complicado que existe para mí y es como un juego que sí Procuro e intento de estar como listo para torneos Entonces si compro muchas Magic que intento estar todo el tiempo como al día porque pues es un negocio también entonces esta carta no la voy a poder usar en tres meses las prohíben y la otra cosa que me gusta mucho pues es el Poker y mi juego favorito se llama Speed y viuda pues a veces la gente me pregunta que si también hago trucos de magia pero pues no lo único que hago es apostar y quitarle su dinero [Música] pues mi siguiente objeto son las gafas de sol La verdad estoy bien ciego no me he preparado los ojos y pues nunca usé gafas de sol hasta hace como dos años y ahora definitivamente no puedo salir sin ellas es como una especie de adicción tengo de todos colores no me enorgullece voy teniendo preferidas como semanalmente y aparte las pierdo o sea las gafas no me duran más de un mes entonces tengo que estar comprando repuestos constantemente me he sentado en ellas mil veces también y la rompo me pasan todo pero cuando encuentro unas que me gustan mucho mucho mucho más bien las dejo de usar las guardo para momentos muy especiales mis primeras gafas se las roba mi papá estuvo muy chido las tuve como un año conmigo hasta que las perdí fue un festival de música me las puse en la noche mala idea y las perdí Pues más bien lo que te robas te lo roban Bueno pues yo tengo una patota y vivo en México me cuesta muchísimo trabajo encontrar tenis y cada vez que compro tenis O encuentro tenis de mi número que intento Buscar siempre que sean Adidas porque me encantan los cuido mucho y los preservo mucho y Una curiosidad es que cuando encuentro compro tres del mismo par porque no sé cuándo vuelva a encontrar de mi número pues como camino todo el día yo no tengo coche me gusta moverme caminando Pues necesito tenías que sean como muy cómodos y sobre todo que los puedo usar con cualquier cosa no me gusta pensar mucho como en qué me pongo las salidas blancos son como mi mi fascinación estos tienen menos de una semana les quedan como cinco semanas de días los tienes con los que hice la preparatoria que no son bueno no son tenis son los zapatos cafés hablan o sea ya están rotos de aquí están rotos de todos lados Pero eso y unos pantalones que fueron como mi segunda piel durante años los guardo a ver si un día los pinto o a ver qué hago Pero sí los tengo Bueno pues yo no llevo pintando mucho tiempo pero estuve en Barcelona viviendo el año pasado y me dio Coby Y me tuve que quedar encerrado en un cuarto como durante 15 días y me llevaron unos lápices unos plumones y ahora Soy adicto a pintar todo el tiempo y es algo que me ayuda mucho a concentrarme Si alguien me está diciendo algo O me estoy aprendiendo un guión o Sencillamente tengo como que pasar el rato dibujarme ayuda mucho como a canalizar todo donde solo se ha vuelto más que un Hobby como una necesidad [Música] Pues bueno yo no tengo una técnica como muy clara entonces una vez como pues jugando aprendí a romper los plumones pues lo suelo romper porque los puedo como exprimir por ejemplo o de pronto puedo jugar a hacer formas con ellos pero no necesariamente dibujo cosas como te explicaré como formas o cosas muy concretas la verdad es que es más abstracto todo para mí El único problema es este que cuando estoy trabajando el departamento de maquillaje me odia este lo hice hace rato Bueno ya está todo bien me gustan a mí este tipo de formas que son como un poco abstractas pero justo lo que me permiten es no prestar mucha atención tampoco a lo que estoy dibujando Y pues luego ya con el color puedes hacer cosas más más divertidas pueden salir cosas más locochonas no sé pintura abstracta como el niño chiquito de este año hace como 300 cuadros y es la primera vez que los mandó a enmarcar me quedan como 25 porque cada vez que hay una fiesta en mi casa los regalo a todo el mundo me gusta jugar mucho con las formas y como les digo dibujar para mí tiene mucho que ver como con canalizar mi atención y entonces se ha vuelto una cosa como que no puedo parar medio Adictiva pero pues me imagino que es una buena adicción Bueno pues la familia de mi papá es de Oaxaca Yo tengo mucha relación con Oaxaca es un estado que me encanta y pues yo aprendí a tomar Mezcal con mi abuelo que en paz descanse yo nunca vi borracho a mi abuelo pero si tomaba un caballito de mezcal después de cada comida y pues siempre me contó una cosa que me gusta mucho pensar y es que el mezcal es la verdadera esencia como de Oaxaca y es como la herencia más fuerte que tenemos los mexicanos es con el espíritu del agave entonces pues el mezcal para mí no nada más es mi país si no mi abuelo y es mi vida favorita por eso si es buen mezcal tiene que hacer estas burbujitas le decimos el anillo pero para comercializarlo por ejemplo aquí en Estados Unidos lo tienen que filtrar entonces si te das cuenta el mezcal está limpio solamente genera estas como burbujitas por el oxígeno pero a mí me gusta mucho y el mezcal que hacía mi abuelo es un mezcal que él curaba Entonces aunque no lo crean los mexicanos ponemos pechugas de pollo adentro de mezcal durante muchísimos meses o canela o clavo para darle un sabor y cuando se murió mi abuelo nos tomamos un mezcal que tenía más de 45 años este curándose que es lo que como le decimos cuando lo preparamos y pues para mí eso es un manjar casi un elixir [Música] Bueno pues mi relación con el Apple watch tiene que ver con que soy muy distraído no no no suelo checar los mensajes mi madre Me dice por ejemplo que enloquece cuando ve que tengo 3000 este mails en gmail que no he leído y que ella le da ansiedad Bueno pues para mí el Apple watch Es una herramienta como necesaria necesaria para poder estar todo el tiempo en contacto con mi trabajo y para poder estar comunicándome con mi familia y mis amigos y que no se me olvidan las cosas entonces básicamente es como una niñera yo no me acuerdo nunca de mi mamá sin un libro en las manos mi mamá es publicista y es mi mejor amiga entonces yo crees rodeado de libros todo el tiempo y cuando tenía 13 años quería ser poeta hasta que me di cuenta que si quiere ser poeta nunca vas a ser poeta y no puedo leer novelas ya no no tengo como la atención que se ocupa para leer novelas entonces de los últimos siete ocho años para acá me dedico como a leer Pues sí hay algo que me gusta mucho hacer es como solo agarrar como pequeñas frases y pues un poco como si fuera ahí Ching me gusta empezar el día leyendo un pequeño poema y darme cuenta aparte que si lo vuelvo a leer al día siguiente es distinto ahorita no se puede hablar mucho de él pero su esposo Ted Hughes que no fue tan no fue tan buen tipo él tiene un poema que de chiquita Me gustó mucho y me lo trató en las piernas que se llama Dios perro aunque no lo crean en mis piernas tengo tatuado Dios perro Pues yo crecí escuchando más bien como al velveto underground capa Tomb Ways ese tipo de situaciones y nada me puede caer peor que la gente que dice que no le gusta el reggaeton para mí este es el artista más grande que existe ahorita en este momento y suelo despertarme todos los días antes de hacer ejercicio Escuchando canciones de Benito de bad Bunny y pues nada también me llena de Orgullo y está poca madre que el artista más grande e importante del planeta hoy sea un puertorriqueño latino creo que pues nos están invitando a la fiesta y ya no nos vamos a salir [Música] estos son los pantalones que uso Casi siempre como para pintar y los uso por dos razones primero son muy cómodos y segundos tienen esto donde puedo atorar cosas y me encanta se le llama workers este tipo pantalones son dikis los empecé a usar Cuando empecé a manchar mi vestuario de las películas trabajando o a mancharme en las manos y después manchar toda mi ropa me tardé un rato en entenderlo pero necesitas tener ropa para pintar sino absolutamente todo va a tener manchitas de de colores y a mí me gusta tener como el estudio de pintura lo más alejado de mi cuarto para que mi caos del estudio no se junte como con mi cuarto Entonces este pues sí me imagino que cambia algo del mindset sobre todo me gusta usar los saltos y pararme derecho cuando Pinto y sentirme ahí un poquito más sangrón [Música] Pues bueno yo no uso joyería no uso anillos nunca había usado como una cadenita y como pueden ver está muy vieja y esta cadena me la regaló mi novia y pues ahora se ha vuelto una especie como de amuleto creo que es lindo como ponerle cierta importancia a los objetos Aunque realmente no la tengan no Entonces cuando hago castings por ejemplo me gusta traerla en la bolsa y cuando tengo un día importante o complicado pues me gusta traerla en la mochila o traerla conmigo para mí es como un objeto que me da cariño y a veces también me la pongo pero la uso más como talismán me gusta mucho la ropa cómoda y soy muy fanático como de la sudaderas y las hoodies y andar como muy suelto Este es mi sudadera favorita es la que intento como usar más y la verdad es que ya me compré dos porque una la manché justamente tenía una blanca de la misma marca y la manché Entonces ahora intento cuidar esta a ver si dura el café se toma caliente se toma sin leche y se toma sin azúcar quien les diga lo contrario no es su amigo pues así empiezo todos los días en todos los días en la mañana me tomo un café y me gusta mucho el expreso me recuerda mucho como a mi papá que es un Cafetero pero de hueso Colorado no y pues por ejemplo nos gusta mucho coleccionar distintas cafeteras hacernos distintos tipos de café y es una conversación que tenemos constantemente no como que estás tomando ahorita o cómo te gusta tomarlo ahorita pero pues es algo igual que los libros que siempre ha estado como conmigo entonces luego huelo café y me siento como en casa de alguna manera [Aplausos] pues estos fueron mis 10 objetos esenciales y nos vemos muy pronto [Música]
GQ Videoseries,foreign hey I'm Travis Barker and these are my 10 Essentials  um we'll start with my wedding ring I just wanted something really simple I love silver I love like white gold I like the just row of pave diamonds it just matches everything it's awesome couldn't think of a better ring my wife's ring is a little more flashy I don't really like something like too flashy I like something that I can wear every day she has like a beautiful band with a row of diamonds and then she has a really really kind of like bigger Diamond that was like our engagement ring that I proposed her with these are my drumsticks I don't go anywhere without these These are literally in my suitcase next to my shoes my underwear my t-shirts whatever I'm bringing sometimes I have like a practice pad kit that goes everywhere with me too but no matter what when you can't get a practice in you can't get a rehearsal Studio it's drumsticks and a pillow pillow makes it really hard to play and there's no bouncing there's no rebound it's like the perfect situation when I was in Drumline as a kid they would always tell us just practice on pillows because like you would get your chops would be way better if you played on pillows these drumsticks are modeled after sd1 generals like a Vic for a stick that I grew up playing in concert band I feel off if I don't have these with me and I feel off if I haven't like rehearsed at all during the day I feel good if it's about an hour like nothing less than an hour like I'm getting ready for a show right now like I have a show tomorrow so I'll just set my timer for an hour and I'll go through everything I want to practice and I I go through drumsticks so fast like I love beat up sticks ones that I practice with and I'll even bring them to shows or rehearse and they break right away which is kind of a bum out this is a necklace I love to wear all the time it's a junior necklace I have another one that's a little bit bigger and some of the spikes were missing because I'd wear it so much when I'm playing it's like it was rusted and some of the spikes would fall off so this is like a new one that I replaced it with but I still wear the one with several spikes missing I don't know it's like the perfect necklace no one has it either I feel like I've never seen anyone else wear it it was given to me someone brought it to me and said do you love this and I said I actually love nothing more I bring it everywhere I go tend to wear it with like when I wear a suit or something nice so I still feel like myself it's just like the perfect accessory this incense is better than any other incense it's called incense of the West and and the the scent is Pinon it literally smells like a wood burning fireplace I go everywhere with it it's burnt throughout my entire house I bring it on tour with me it's in my dressing rooms it's in my hotel rooms everyone that comes to my studio asks can I please ask you what that smell is and it's always this they come in these little sticks people will come and just leave with a few of these little sticks I have these little they're kind of like candle holders they're just like almost like a plate and I buy this black sand and you place these instant sticks inside the sand then when it's like done burning it almost looks like ashes the worst is when people come here and they confuse it for an ashtray there's like Backwoods and rolling paper everything in there but yeah the best incense one of my favorite candles I bring everywhere it's called concrete after lightning it's such like a smaller candle I wish it came in a bigger size but it lasts so long I've accidentally left it on for multiple days at a time and there's still wax left so it doesn't like burn too quick literally like makes the entire house smell like this scent it's one of my favorite scents honestly it's a little musky but I have a few candles I go back and forth with and this is one of them I buy in like bulk and I bring it everywhere with me this is the candle rare DS and Durga it's one of my favorites this is a collaboration between a company I have called DTA and I can never pronounce his name Theory lottery I just call him Terry and we designed these about a year ago and they drop in like the next month or two I had always loved his glasses and I bought other frames from him so like the idea is like when you collaborate with him it's like you take an existing frame and you make it yours you freak it you flip it somehow so the name of this Frame is called mastermindy but they never made him in the matte finish we made them in a black matte finish and did a little branding and I love really Square kind of almost like low glasses that I grew up wearing I don't go anywhere without them it's my favorite frame my favorite sunglass every day it's these this is Barker Wellness two-in-one face cleanser and mask so for so long I literally would take a bar of soap and wash my face I would take the same lotion I was putting on my body and I would put it on my face like I don't know it took years to figure out like skin care or even like worrying about like going out in the sun or wearing sunblock when I was going down that path I noticed a lot of products weren't vegan a lot of them you could find like you know like toxic chemicals in it so it was really important when I went on the journey to create Barker Wellness to build a void of what was missing for me and that was like simple skincare that was like cruelty free non-toxic and vegan this is unisex but for so many males I think we're lost and we kind of kind of like figure it out ourselves and I think like we all care about it like we all care if like our Skin's clean or if we're using like good products and for me just knowing that I'm using something where no animals got hurt I'm stoked I stayed away from Bluetooth headphones forever because they said they might cause brain tumors or cancer and then I tried these and it was like undeniable I love him like the minute you put them on your ears and your phone's next to you it connects which is the biggest problem with anything Bluetooth that you're going through your phone you're resetting whatever the speakers or the headphones and it doesn't connect right away these connect right away they're also noise canceling I fall asleep sometimes listening to audiobooks on planes I'll just put them on just to cancel out any noise that's going around they're so good I practice with them for hours a day I'm at hotels like listening to mixes it's this my car and then just the speaker from my phone I've never had a more honest headphone I probably spend a few hours a day with these last essential is my phone there's like an app that's like a Metrodome so I practice to it all the time like the Under Armor app I know how far I run my favorite
GQ Videoseries,is just to run and put on whatever new music's on and be surprised or like learn about something new there's a piano app I can literally be in the studio and while we start writing things I can come up with other melodies or I can listen and be like I want to add this or find out what key it's in I love that I love Shazam wherever I'm at in the world I'm like what the is like I want to know what song this is I also just love taking photos on it like my favorite photos some of my favorite photos that I ever post it's just from an iPhone there's this app shout out Happy Cow it's the best invention ever but it basically tells you wherever you're at in the world what vegan options you have within like however many miles you want to choose we've stumbled upon the most amazing vegan restaurants through this app which results in us being at dinner like taking photos of of food 11th Madison in New York Gautier in London it's a Michelin rated restaurant that just went vegan that wasn't plant-based before Crossroads there's so many things I use it for thank you guys for watching these are my essentials foreign
GQ Videoseries,these are hiking boots These are actually from Pharrell's line called human race me and Pharrell made a lot of music together for many many years it was called the Nicktoons and my music career let's say has stalled but he makes a hell of a hiking boot hi GQ it's me Nick Kroll these are 10 essential items that I cannot live without on the road  good catch Nick these are uh Cape Cod salt and vinegar potato chips I always have some salt minis ready to go wherever I am it's essential because you want that back of that they're potato chips but because there's vinegar and this is scientific because vinegar is like it means that it kills all the fat and that's science usually my pre-show meal is like a massive bowl of uh Bolognese it's like a salad bowl size of pasta but if I don't have time a bag of salt and Vinnies that'll do the trick give me a little something a little fuel to get through the show and also you can't beat that crunch foreign so this is GQ you know it's for stylish folks it's a Lads mag so I thought I'd show you probably the sexiest
GQ Videoseries,about me and that's my toiletry bag my dab kit I have a number of different antihistamines that I have with me at all times because I'm constantly having massive allergic reactions because I seem to be allergic to the world fellas you know what the ladies love is Savannah cream free of dyes fragrance masking fragrance lanolin parabens and from formaldehyde releasers then let's get into the big boys folks eucrisa is a non-steroidal cream that I put on my face I've always been allergic but one of the cool things about getting older is that your body gets worse the things that used to be slightly irritating you become incredibly irritating to you there's one
GQ Videoseries,that I always have with me when I'm on the road and that is a spare tire it really is it's an essential because you might get a flat tire or you might find a bunch of babies who want to do CrossFit can you imagine like a baby just like doing that over and over with a tire it's awesome it's awesome to see babies taking care of their bodies I want to see babies do pull-ups I want to see babies push Tires over and over I want to see babies do burpees and I'm not talking about a cute word for burps because babies do burpees no I want to see babies jump up in the air then get down do a push-up then stand back up and do another jump in the air so every comedian has some version of this like you have your notebook that you jot notes in I always have one of these I try to lose this like every four to five months and then what I try to do it's it's in my rider I was trying to make sure to have at least three to four uh broken pens to have with me to write down notes for things jot down set lists jot to new ideas these are always good to have a pen that has literally nothing inside of it and I'll be like this is disgusting I can't believe I'm using this pen to write down my notes like how many hands have touched this pen and within like 10 minutes of being backstage in The Green Room I'm like hmm so this is the notes from my from when I was working on my hour for little big boy now on Netflix it says your snacks and then it's this problematic eater and then an arrow and it says turn into income whether that was a note for the set or a note for my life it's worked out pretty well and let's just say I don't have to ask for salt and Vinnies in the green room I can buy myself [Laughter]  when I'm not getting jacked up on coffee all day long I do like to have tea I really do drink a ton of Throat Coat when I'm on tour before a show it helps my voice but also when I'm doing voice over animation I drink literally pictures of throw coat all day long because this voice and then going right into this and then we finish right back here takes a toll on my throat so I like to get that throw coat frankly to coat that throat just a PSA if someone says I want to coat your throat they probably don't mean throw Coat tea you gotta have a tea kettle around that's always on my rider it's weird this one I guess belongs to some guy named Max they let me use it that's nice and this is matcha I love to hate matcha who what is everybody doing I know everybody loves matcha it tastes like grass and not that good kind you know what I'm saying both I can do this it's legal not interested in matchup so when you go on tour you have a rider what you don't realize is that the artists pay for their Riders so forever I'd be like yeah let's get cold cuts let's get buried let's get it that's my big extravagance is cold cuts you order everything you could ever imagine and then afterwards I realized like oh I was paying for those in every venue because I'd leave them behind one of the things that I would have asked for at every location was a yoga mat I want a yoga mat wherever I go so that I can stare at it and then not use it so I brought this one from home you can tell it's being used oh look at that that's crazy I guess an
GQ Videoseries,for me is my big mouth yoga mat you guys should get one at home too I do yoga I really actually love it I mean down dog just for the pure sexual undertones to it Warrior three I also like and that's when I get banged out by two dudes wearing Gladiator outfits what else Mountain that's where you're just sort of standing up straight but I actually do I always feel better when I do yoga foreign oftentimes when I can request a food like if in my green room or if I'm doing like a shoot for GQ Essentials I'll say things that I want to have on the day but really I just want to have so that I don't have to do grocery shopping later for example I always have asked for organic eggs so that I can take those home lobna labna is like sort of a yogurty spread my son likes it with his oatmeal and his fruit and berries uh it's delicious these blueberries look like they were grown on a farm on Mars they're massive I do like to say blueberries are nature's candy mmm unwashed this is a hmm well this is a multi-use
GQ Videoseries,as I've gotten older I have found the zucchini to be a very versatile vegetable and you're the one who's being gross right now I do like uh some Ramen at home a noodles in general Momofuku Dave Chang's an old buddy of mine I get no money from this but every now and again I get to go to his house and he'll cook me and my family lunch I do love uh oh a garlic chili crunch oil I really like to hike especially in Los Angeles these are hiking boots These are actually from Pharrell's line called human race the problem with like hiking shoes in general is they're always like 4 000 terribly ugly colors what I like about these is they're just all black they're very simple I would say Runyon Canyon where I think is probably the most known area to go hiking in La I think a lot of influencers are there if you ever watch people hiking on Runyon Cannon you can see a lot of people with real demons  so there's obviously some stuff here that's like kind of a joke but I have a couple things that are actually really important to me that I never leave home without I have this locket and it says always in my heart I have things that are really close to me here um one is a picture of me and the other is chocolate pretzels because I love chocolate pencils I love how there's chocolate on the outside and if I have to eat the ones with dark chocolate I will because I want to be healthy but then the inside is like crunchy and salty pretzels and I just when I'm away from home I want to remember how I can just polish off an entire huge bag of chocolate pretzels and not even remember that I've eaten it so I keep this Locker right right here I keep it I keep this like here I keep this is either a mini theragon or my vibrating butt plug and I don't remember which it is that feels pretty good let me just just do a quick check this mini theragon is really nice because it's a little quieter than the regular therabont so you can be on the plane you know what I mean and just get to work I think we're all like pretty uh stressed out and my wife told me about fascia recently it's like the wrapping paper to the present that is our body we have to be better about loosening that wrapping paper and so we really got to keep our fascia loose and we got a burp and we need to burp we have to burp anyway thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed a small glimpse into my weird sad life on the road
GQ Videoseries,thank you you could have just handed it to me hey GQ I'm Matthew Perry and these are my essentials this is my Batman hat I wear this you know because I am Batman and uh it's pretty cool and I like to watch the movie Batman while wearing this but just this my love for Batman um started really with the Chris Nolan movies at Christian Bale being Batman I thought that was really cool Mike Heaton played him and he's probably my favorite actor and this newest one the Batman is really really good too so he's kind of a loner he's rich um he solves crime I also solve crime um so I can relate to Batman very much also you know you're always able to relate to Somebody That You Are  this is probably my favorite
GQ Videoseries,that I have so bad man watch when I got it I was in Hong Kong No One understood what I was saying so I had to find it all by myself in a three level mall and I did find it but that was one of the times that I was like I'm I'm famous somebody help me but I found it and it's here and it's gorgeous and it tells time which I think is good okay these are keys to my car which is National Martin which I was able to buy because I was on Friends I drive this if I have to go somewhere I'm not really a car guy but I do like my car which is an Aston Martin convertible and it looks like the Batmobile so I drive it around to pretend that I am Batman  this is one of my favorite things I have an iPad and a keyboard so they're sort of attached but then you can separate them I don't know how to separate them there we go so there's that uh I'm going to close it because you never know what's going to pop up I wrote a screenplay on this I wrote a book on this and uh I should try to keep it to that you know writing it's it's more elegant than the other things you can do with it the book is called friends lovers and the big terrible
GQ Videoseries,and it is about kind of my rise to fame while battling this horrible disease that I have so um it's very serious it was pretty easy to write it kind of fell off fell onto the page but then when I had to read it it was much much harder and much more sad because my life has been a difficult one and I was honest in the book about that and when I read it I thought to myself man what a hard life this guy's gone through and then I realized it's me that I'm talking about you know it gets dark so bring you know a flashlight with you foreign  in my office which is my favorite place in my new house I have a um that computer that I showed you and I use that iPad to I used it to write down the everything about the screenplay and the book and it was just really easy to write the screenplay and I was sitting in a in a a real office chair but it it was a Batman real office chair and as the Batman insignias now it's gone way too much I'm realizing today that I have too much Batman stuff so I'm going to get Wonder Woman stuff and walk around town  this is my favorite hair gel this particular product was introduced to me during a photo shoot where uh they changed my hair all together it was a cover shoot and they changed they cut my hair differently and I stuck with this because it was familiar but it was a scary day because they gave me like this crazy hairstyle and it was a cover sheet so you can see here I use it a lot because there's not much left but you only need a little bit so this will last me like a month but it's you know it's sort of half waxed and half gel also I am that way  foreign
GQ Videoseries,we have these are Batman sweats and I will uh sleep in them occasionally and uh they really say Batman on them so yeah there's no personality complex or anything because all I have to do is look at my left eye and I know who I am okay so at my home I have a Batman room that is either called the mat cave or bat cave and it's just filled with all my Batman stuff it's not really special mementos or anything but I have Batman statues and Batman like it's a very full room because people finally figured out what they should get me for my birthday or for Christmas okay this is a black uh t-shirt I'm not really a big fashion guy but like I like this shirt it's a very simple black T-shirt works with everything fits in with my car so um I can drive around and kind of camouflage myself with a black T-shirt and a black line so it looks like nobody's driving um so James purse is probably my favorite I even have a James Perez ping pong table I'm pretty good at ping pong all racket Sports I kind of excel at because I played all the time as a kid so I played for like 10 hours a day so I like I like my ping pong table I'm better at that than I am at pool yes at one point I was a nationally ranked tennis player boys under 14. I was 17th in the country in Canada you know the tennis is much better in La so when I came to La I was killed by everybody and had to decide for a different career path you said  okay this is pretty dressy for me but these are my black boots so if I I usually wear running shoes and Converse and stuff like that but if I want to you know dress up I I bring these um this is the left one and this is the right one well I thought these just looked really cool and they go with a lot of stuff that I own and again when I want to be dressy I put these on yeah these are sunglasses  I like the uh the fact that they shaved the Sun and I kind of like that they're they have a little John Lennon feeling to them because they're around so I think they're cool sometimes if I don't want to be seen I'll wear that Happy song and these glasses but also sometimes that just screams that you're famous so I try not to wear that combo a lot but sometimes I do foreign thank you GQ for having me it's a pleasure showing you my essentials and you know by seeing them you should probably know by now that I'm Batman
GQ Videoseries,obviously it makes me feel like I'm dry or Pharrell because in my mind I am that's what GarageBand does it makes you feel like you can do the impossible and then you send your song to your homies they laugh at you it doesn't matter cause I don't laugh at me and GarageBand didn't laugh at me hey what's happening GQ this is Aldous Hodge and these are my 10 Essentials first up my sketch pad look at this beauty bam this book has been with me as long as I have been a horological designer foreign I started designing watches randomly for a school project and I sort of became enamored with the idea of the movements the intricacies of the composition when it comes to gear trades things like that I just Dove deep in around like 18 19 years old and I've been designing ever since as you can see it is very much well worn I've kept it up with the Advent of magical tape every now and then I'll throw a sticker on there as you see Black Adam the most special sticker here is this one Golden Heart when I had my daughter she was born early she was in the NICU for like two months they used Golden Hearts to tape their wires and breathing apparatus to them so this is one for my daughter she represents everything for me strength belief hope and that's what this book is all my dreams in here everything comes down to that first design so this is probably my most prized and precious material possession when it comes to Drafting and designing you need a good pencil and that leads me to my number two essential my Muji mechanical pencils  legit I love that store I love everything Muji it's just amazing they give you the most simple basic things in the best package possible but for me 0.5 millimeter pencil this
GQ Videoseries,it's how I start it's how I finish if I am sitting anywhere and I do not have one of these pencils I get a great deal of anxiety because then I cannot work I just love Muji they do some cool stuff I go in there I buy about 20 30 40 50 pencils just so I'm never in short supply you would not catch me out in these streets slipping just saying boom I gotta carry all of this in something my Tumi book bag boom kill me first of all every time you get a bag I love how they monogram it ABS you know I'm saying got me feeling important got me feeling special and fancy I'm like okay I'm Mr high jump in here you know you know it's practical it's well made but they also have really nice designs when I think about design DNA I think to me has that I got some hand sanitizer got to keep that on hand you know what I'm saying code without any streets be wild I got some lotion because you know ashy Knuckles is it's a situation not about to be out here shaming my mama I specifically look for the bags with all the compartments that can hold all of my stuff sketch pads my pencils to my computers to my paperwork to my passport all that I don't know why I need all this stuff I mean this bag is at least 50 pounds probably why I got back problems in fact I'm gonna go out on the limb and say it is the reason I got back problems but it's worth it because I need my stuff that leads me to my next essential which is my laptop  essential number four this is where a lot of my life lives because I got a lot of things to put up on this and Joint obviously final draft because if you're a writer that's a staple things like solid work SolidWorks is premiere for any sort of designer or design engineer iMovie when it comes to editing it's actually pretty awesome and GarageBand whenever I'm writing a movie I by no means am a producer but I like to play around with a garage band to create tracks that I use to become the pulse of my films as I see them in my head plus I got two terabytes yeah oh that's a lot of space we're gonna move to literature Holy Grail right here when it comes to horological knowledge I'm Shuffling through these books right here to go do my my Fang George Daniels his brother wrote the Bible Georgetown is watchmaking it's going to teach you about practical application to horology also got complicated watchmaking Francois liquid me if anybody digs into watches you might know that name and then this book right here by J.R Caswell horology it gives you the base foundation so that you can approach the mathematics and easier way simplifying any complicated means of design is how you define your own DNA as a designer simplify everything number six what is the culmination of learning those things practical design now I have a non-working prototype people are always saying well why do you have a non-working watch because you show the process you show the progress jumping into Black Adam I immediately hit my manufacturing partner I want to just show a piece of scope of an idea what it could be and you know show that on my character because the filmmakers were gracious enough to let me do so so I created a peace unique dial the dial itself was a dial that I designed explicitly for my character Carter Hall to represent his lineage there are different iterations of his backstory but one of them is Prince Khufu he was an Egyptian prince I looked through the Egyptian Book of the Dead as a motif for the style that I felt was quite significant and representational of Carter Hall for who he is and where we meet him in the film you know we have a lot of temporary metals like brass steel calf skin on the strap a butterfly deployment class but the design is not final lies but you know this allows me to get a sense of the feel on the wrist and the weight so for me this will forever remain a huge Staple in the process that legitimizes me in the space as someone who is committed to the true craft of virology at the same time it allows me to wear something super cool in the film and I get to also wear my own prototype that I've also been working on for about 15 16 years this is just a very early step towards the process of something that you will see hopefully very soon your boy loves jewelry but look I'm not trying to be bling now that's not the point very much a different trait than making watches both my sister my mother are gemologists this ring right here now the primary Stone here is garnet colors match hogman's costume beautiful wonderfully perfectly but I chose Garnet because it is my mother's favorite Stone so for me there's a couple personal ties there but this is a ring that they made for Hawkman which I wear proudly in the movie which I'm really grateful for and I love I'm going to cherish this forever when I think about men's jewelry and being able to have creative options Dave and yerman is a spot I love what they do I mean right now I'm wearing two of their gold chains box chains I'm also wearing two of their spinel pieces their spinel necklaces which for me I love just because the stone spinel is awesome it also is very similar to my other favorite Stone which is black diamonds as you see here boom and boom boom boom boom boom boom it is a diamond that is not highly prioritized or highly valued amongst the space of diamonds but it's one that I value greatly in all its Darkness it still reflects Grand light in the greatest way possible being an actor coming up I've been opposed to simply because of the color of my skin but I've had to shine baby shine in this little Stone I can find some kinship in that even if the rest of the world doesn't look at you in the same way or values you the same way you still deserve to be valued you still are beautiful so for me I think black diamonds and I will always have a relationship now we move on to essential number eight your boy got to smell good I got to smell fresh incomes YSL the noodle  [Applause] obviously you see I've used up most of it because this stuff is awesome it is cool to find a cool loan that works with your whole body like people don't realize you can't just spray on something it's going to smell good on everybody it mixes with your natural scents metabolically creating a whole new scent and some folks walk around here feeling good feeling like they're smelling fresh they just be stinking me when I tried this song I found my spot my place and I was like oh this is it this is hidden this is my goal and that pushes me to essential number nine Carol's daughter now Carol we never met you and your daughter whatever y'all be making I really appreciate your work I deal with a lot of dandruff sometimes be a little dry because you know your boy doesn't drink a whole lot of water like I should be looking like the Alps up here your boy be flaky in these streets and I'm not ashamed to just let you know and this is definitely a staple grow up knowing about Carol's Daughter obviously got a mom got a sister you know what I'm saying so for some reason it hits it works and it smells good back to this back to the sense people lesson of the day smell good simple  I had gotten a really bad Brash breakout over my face in the middle of shooting I was like I gotta go to work the next day this looks terrible how am I gonna fix it up so I spoke to a great friend of mine Miss Debbie a legendary makeup artist so she put me in touch with her colleague Dr Syeda Salam who created this brand shuishi her and her sister both of them are black women who started this brand who understand

GQ Videoseries,[Música] hola como estan soy diego luna y estoy aquí con youtube a punto de enseñarles mis 10 objetos esenciales más mi abuelo era fotógrafo y tenía una es un montón de cámaras una colección de cámaras y entonces cuando murió mi abuelo mi padre y yo fuimos después la repartición de cosas y nos quedamos con el equipo de fotografía y montamos un cuarto oscuro en mi caso que tendría como 13 años yo creo y aprendí a fotografía haría reveladas y ahora además con es una tentación en digital y los teléfonos que ya son cámara y son todo entonces es bueno regresar a la fotografía que tiene que ver con pues sí con todo ese proceso que no se da automáticamente no que te exige pensar cuál es la mejor forma de fotografiar un momento un objetivo una persona [Música] es una salsa de habanero la verdad es que siempre siempre tengo algún tipo de salsa el habanero es buenísimo porque es definitivo el habanero pica cabrón y no hay duda de que de que este de que se lo echas y también porque cuando viajas pues sobre todo en estas promociones que se están moviendo de un lugar a otro y generalmente comes en hoteles y todo sale un poco a lo mismo y además persiste el síndrome del jamaicón o la tristeza de casa te dan ganas de que las cosas piquen y luego no pican o te pones una borrachera y no te puedes echar algo típicos o en la mañana entonces si una salsa es bueno siempre josé bueno que tengo una hija y un hijo es que les puedo robar sus cosas ésta está bocina es de mi hija y me la traje al viaje porque es por eso porque no me gusta escuchar música con audífonos siento que además me pierdo yo la relación con él con el exterior no la posibilidad de darme cuenta que algo más está pasando y pues nada que le robe su su bocina a mi hija que regresará intacta no te preocupes magnani pues también cada que prendo esta bocina o cada que la uso pues me acuerdo de mi hija y cuando me ha tocado robarme la de mi hijo pues es similar esta vez la nota ranchero música no fíjate que yo creo que yo creo que casi este es un tipo muy muy seco muy frío es de la música ranchera este no la soportaría no la soportaría el creo que prefiere lo instrumental en todo momento no esté por miedo a romperse no por miedo a romperse él tiene que guardar la compostura te digo que es una espía es este no es un tipo que tiene tiempo para para para entrarle al sentimiento y me gusta mucho cocinar entonces viajar con sus cuchillos es importante no con esta cosa de que todo el mundo viaja y se queda en casas de otras personas ya sea que te la prestan ya sea que te la rentan ya sea que por una aplicación la consigues y hay la menor interacción pero generalmente ya llegas al espacio de alguien y llegar al spa a la cocina de alguien siempre es como muy íntimo y probablemente esté decepcionante porque pues cada quien cocina como le gusta y eso es muy específico entonces yo cuando viajo y entré a una cocina me gusta venir con con un cuchillo con el que me sienta cómodo y que es que me recuerde cómo me gusta cocinar a mí y además que me permita sentirme en casa rápidamente [Música] este en particular viene de pues viene de estar aquí en nueva york es la historia de un restaurante en nueva york de un chef que de un chef que sirve cocina italiana aquí en nueva york yo iba a ir a italia y que iba a venir aquí dando en este tour promocionando andor y quería leer algo que tuviera que ver con los espacios y los lugares a los que iba a ir más bien los lugares a los que iba a ir y sobre la cocina y una amiga una amiga en españa me recomendó me recomendó este libro y es increíble porque me dio al clavo así el perfecto es lo que quería leer en este en este momento este es un pastillero a ver vamos a ver que hay aquí adentro [Música] y adentro de vitamina c vitamina d importantísima a raíz de la pandemia resultó que tenemos que tomar una diaria y yo no sabía estas son las vitaminas que pues sí que me acompañan todos los días y digo en particular estas porque nunca me las como siempre se me olvida entonces es cierto que en esta cajita en la bolsa como pues no sé prácticamente dos o tres semanas y ahora que la saque pues prometo ya tomar malas bueno esta es una es una máscara una mascarilla tapabocas como quieran decirle y es de tela y ahora me acompaña siempre porque si algo me preocupa es que ahora nos ponemos la máscara ya con cualquier pretexto todas desechables y donde acabarán esas máscaras es algo que de verdad me preocupa muchísimo nada máscara una mascarilla con tapabocas de tela además es más rico [Música] supongo que hay mucha gente que esté ya incluso ni reconocer a estos objetos esto es un lápiz se usaban mucho antes y esta es una pluma a todo mundo solía traer una pluma con cine hoy sales a la calle y pides una pluma probablemente dos de cada diez te dirán si yo traigo uno y serán como escritores este de mi edad o incluso el más grandes a mí me gusta traer siempre un la ficción a pluma en la mochila y me recuerda que soy de otra generación básicamente esto que tengo aquí no me gustaría que estuviera entre mis diez objetos esenciales pero no hay forma de viajar y de estar en una promoción si no viajas con todo esto cables de todo tipo porque las empresas de tecnología no se han puesto de acuerdo o más bien no tienen la intención de ponerse de acuerdo y que haya un cable que te sirva para todo si tienes un teléfono de una marca es este si tienes uno de otra marca es este dentro de una misma marca si cambias de teléfono cambias de cable las clavijas para que sirvan en europa en inglaterra en eeuu en eeuu y méxico cuando tiene este piquito que no entiendo por qué a veces lo tiene y a veces no lo tiene en fin es un desastre nos hemos vuelto esclavos de los cables y las clavijas que tenemos que tener para que nuestros dispositivos funcionen [Música] o sea pues una libreta supongo que es como un reflejo de tu de tu mente de cómo funciona tu mente pero no la una libreta generalmente siempre empiezo así con esta va a ser la libreta de este proyecto y al rato ya hay una receta y un teléfono una dirección este de repente el agarro mi hijo mi hija y se opusieron a dibujar pero eso es ese caos me gusta en una libreta ahí hay que hay que replantearse las cosas tú escribes algo en la inmediatez de un momento y después si lo quieres compartir pues lo tienes que transcribir y transcribir lo es una oportunidad de mejorarlo este gracias a todos ya todos por escucharnos tonterías que estén muy bien [Música]

eggs um obviously like rice and like noodle dishes are really really great i discovered this before the bear came around uh and i was really useless in the kitchen so this was especially helpful since then we started the bear and i've learned a couple more things and yeah i will have this everywhere with me it's uh it's delicious i have these gloves you can pick them up anywhere they're like 299 399 really inexpensive i have a lot of them i'm always losing them i'll find a park with an outdoor gym that's how i like to exercise i'll bring some jump rope and i'll do some pull-ups push-ups dips all that stuff all that stuff can be pretty rough on your hands they make you look pretty serious i like exercising outside especially in new york in these uh in these outdoor uh gyms in the parks because there's always going to be someone there that's tougher than you so i find that i'll get sort of quietly competitive um and i'll end up training a little bit harder whenever you do pull-ups you should take your rings off so i'm going to talk a little bit about my jewelry  this is really the first piece of jewelry that i ever started wearing that's just a nice little w my last name is white and i actually i bought this for my father for christmas but he's got really big fingers and they didn't fit so it became mine this is just a really simple little gold chain and on it here is a

GQ Videoseries,I'm be grills and these are my 10  Essentials some dried maggots and you might think why would any human being want to take maggots with them but the
GQ Videoseries,is maggots have saved me so many times in the wild you know sometimes especially on running wild on the adventures you know you might you know you traveling the whole day and I'm always kind of hopeful are going to come across something some you know bird eggs or catch a fish or even a carcass of an animal generally always find those if you hike for long enough but my backup plan is always maggots they're hard to defend apart from on the basis of good nutrition and they can save your life and they're generally pretty accessible to find especially if you're in forests or rainforests or you know generally even out and about when everything goes wrong maggots they've saved me uh many times and great nutrition lot lot of protein can save your life and actually don't taste so bad Land Rover Defender although not a model of it Land Rover been part of part of our cruise Life part of our filming Life part of my adventure life for many years you know we're operating in a lot of difficult inaccessible terrains around the world having vehicles that don't break down reliable and that you don't feel bad about smacking them around a bit you knowz cuz they definitely get a beat up on a lot of these jungle tracks and I think you form connections with gear and things that you trust and I definitely have that with the Land Rover Defender I have such sort of memory of it always as being there you know in the big moments in adventure moments even if was camping with the family you know it wasn't always just about deserts and jungles and mountains throw everything in the back we know it's basically going to get us there in one piece good vehicle Land Rover Defender my favorite still to this day is what we use okay so the
GQ Videoseries,on my list of Essentials an unusual one but it is something that helps me a lot beef liver desiccated dried beef liver this stuff's called carnivore aelia it's a brand that I can of love and use quite hardcore when you eat this when you first try it it's like oh wow that is that is quite intense but I've grown to really love it it's my kind of snack of choice when we're out there and also super healthy you know to be having I mean this it's well known for amongst those who know that liver is a real kind of Super King food in terms of health you only have to look at the animal kingdom first
GQ Videoseries,that a lion will go for straight in for the soft organs and above all the prized liver you only have to hang out with enough indigenous tribes and Indigenous people around the world to realize how much they value liver after a kill when they're hunting and I've learned to listen to Nature listen to indigenous people and listen to the animals so if it's good enough for them for me liver even though it's an acquired taste I love it so the
GQ Videoseries,for me is a little wooden cross something super easy super light small something I always throw in my bag when I'm traveling I'm not always particularly religious but I definitely have a sort of quiet faith in here and this cross just comes with me and it just reminds me of the important things in life you know walk humbly try and be kind look after people along the way that for me symbolizes a lot of that anything that gives us strength and helps us dayto day is a good
GQ Videoseries,LA Dodgers baseball cap where I'm from in the UK baseball caps aren't quite as popular but my best buddy Dell who is American loves the LA Dodgers and one time he said bear the Dodgers have asked you to throw the first baseball of the Season we got to do this I remember were actually having this ball and and covering it in a little bit of fire paste and then lighted this
GQ Videoseries,and it was like flaming and I threw that first pitch and I didn't tell them I was going to light it I thought otherwise the fire department will start freaking out and at the end all worked and they they loved it but I remember Dell told me two things one is he said make sure you throw it hard enough there's nothing worse than throwing the first and and not reaching so I really gave it the full Welly and secondly he said make sure you get a LA Dodgers cap at the end reminds me of great City great times and my good buddy so my next
GQ Videoseries,would probably be a really good off-road ebike these are the ones that I use called Magic Cycles you know I've tried loads of different brands over the years but I just love the freedom that some of these especially these new ebikes give you you could kind of Pound The Hills in a way that it's almost impossible to do on a regular bike and it's kind of instant access to Adventure and also they're great just for riding around town as well doing manyi Adventures with the family you know there's nothing worse than kind of if you're a family and and you're okay but little little one can't keep up but ebikes transform that
GQ Videoseries,on my list of Essentials Revolution race windproof waterproof outter jacket you know there's so many Brands out there everyone will have their favorite but this for me has become a kind of firm favorite looks good does the job really well they're not expensive either we get through a ton of jackets always just getting trashed or burnt or over fire or whatever it is it's going to take a beating if you're out there you got good Pockets you easy get things also you it's little things like when your hands are really cold you know you don't want tiny little zippers that you can't reach cuz you you haven't got much dexterity in your fingers so things like having decent zippers and accessible pouches and I'm always hesitant I never wanted to be like we're selling a sort of
GQ Videoseries,but you know as an adventure you find brands that you really like and you believe in if I don't want gear and I don't want clothing it's going to let me down in the big moments you want to be able to depend on stuff and these guys do it for me cardio miracle all about trying to help your heart stay strong help your immune system stay strong you know there are zillion different supplements on the market and everyone finds their kind of
GQ Videoseries,this is very technical but it's quite deep so when i need to it's kind of like a mask and i have my cover mask and then i have the hat but now i've just sold myself out because if you if you ever see this hat it's not me g'day gq i'm jacob belordi and these are my 10 essentials  had a watch with me you know for as long as i can remember since i was small but it's not so much sort of like the time keeping aspect i like the weight of it and i like the way that it feels it helps me kind of not feel naked i suppose this watch is from tag it's the monaco i got this just recently in monaco this is the dark lord steve mcqueen wore the original monaco with the blue face of this back in the day kind of feels like a cool piece of history to have then i you know i found out there's pictures online of stanley kubrick on the set of clockwork orange with a monaco as well so it kind of has a rich cinematic history which is you know it's exciting  this is a recent essential a deck of cards is a recent essential to me i have never understood cards my whole life i could never learn card games i didn't have the patience for them i was reading val kilmer's book of poetry someone at the start it might even share i think it might have been share cher said he had this poker chip that he would flick between his fingers and she asked him like why are you always flicking the poker chip and he said i don't know what i'm gonna need it and then his film with his came out and it cut to a scene and he was sitting at the table for no reason flicking the poker chip and she was like and so i was like you know what i don't know anything about cards i don't know how to handle them i don't know how to shuffle but i was like i want to have a you know i want to have a poker chip i want to be able to just pull out something sometime whether it's a deck of cards i don't know i'll learn a little blackjack i'll learn a little play this game called slapjack it's a high-stakes game of snap i don't play for money i play for the thrill of it  this next
GQ Videoseries,is um it's not specifically always this um you know a cigarette case i don't smoke this has post-it notes in it i consider it like a totem and i always carry one of these especially when i'm creating a character it's something that kind of centers the character for me or gives me a base you know i have it in my pocket all the time when i'm shooting and this was playing um a character in the film i just shot called he went that way and it was set in the late 1950s and he was this young kid who got discharged from the army and went on a spree killing sort of across america and he smoked a lot of cigarettes so i found this on etsy which is kind of this period cigarette case and i had this on me the whole time i was filming i don't know it sounds a little pretentious but this is like has the soul of the character in and then i can put it to the side when i go home the first films i ever made i had a this uh this silver necklace and the
GQ Videoseries,is i have to i have to buy it myself and it's kind of uh i wouldn't say ocd because it feels more spiritual than that but it you know i guess it converges on that kind of idea i have a lot of different cameras but this camera is a medium format rolleiflex this particular camera is special because there's this great documentary called i think it's called i am heath ledger it's one of the cameras that he uses so this is definitely one of my most valuable cameras to me i think the lens is glass and you know the pictures are crisp and there's just something kind of timeless there's a very satisfying feeling that comes from hearing the shadow the main
GQ Videoseries,that i you know that i try to shoot is the people around me and the things that are happening around me because i feel a lot of the time when i first came to uh to hollywood you know so much of it is you wouldn't believe it so for me it's just kind of about catching all these memories and moments so that you know maybe one day i'll just sit in a big house alone and i'll just flick through them all and i'll have you know i'll have them all there you know it'll be like they're all with me i think i mean i've already felt the effect it would have thousands of printed photos at home in boxes you know and every now and then you'll just go through the box and it's just like you can smell the room you're in you can hear the people speaking you can feel the moment you know what was going on around you in that time you know that's like it's kind of magic  my next essential is uh fairly simple it's just a cap just a black cap this particular cap is from um it's from left bank books which is a little bookstore in new york this is very technical but it's quite deep so when i need to it's kind of like a mask you know when i have my cover mask and then i have the hat but now i've just sold myself out because if you if you ever see this hat it's not me somebody else that bought the hat from this tiny little bookstore you know when superheroes in the superhero films are like being regular people and it's like chris evans in a bomber jacket with like the most standard sunglasses you've ever seen and a black cap i think that was the goal it's like when i go outside i'm like i'm out in public like you know i'm not saying i'm a superhero out in public at all i think it was just that like it's kind of like witness protection so you know what i mean  this
GQ Videoseries,is a uh is a tote bag somehow even if they look small it's kind of like hermione's bag um you know in harry potter and she just like pulls a pulls a tent out of it you know it's kind of like that you just like keep digging and you will find everything you've ever lost in this bag i have too many tote bags tote bags also expensive now i got one at an art gallery the other day it cost 54 but i didn't yes i paid for it because i didn't know at the time and then they were like that'd be 54 and i can't really i just get so nervous i'm like of course it would be yeah i'll definitely pay for that that sounds about right it's ridiculous you know i was too nervous to be like for a tote bag ah this one did not cost that much like i don't even wear that one because i'm like disgusted with myself  i do always always have this with me everywhere i go this here is a little traveler's notepad this is just you know personal thoughts it's by my bed when i fall asleep in case you know i have a dream or something like that my theory is with having so many books on me all the time is you never know when you're going to end up in a hospital waiting room which sounds dark but the amount of times that i have ended up in a hospital waiting room for some ridiculous
GQ Videoseries,and i have to wait like eight hours and you have nothing to do and you know i don't like sitting on my phone so the theory behind it is that you never know when you're going to be in a hospital waiting room this is a set of plays by tennessee williams for if i'm in the mood for that and then i also like to have like fiction on me this is just another personal notepad that i've had for a little while this is a workbook a journal for the character i'm about to play in this this film i'm doing and i found this recently in madrid this kind of adam and eve notepad and it kind of something about it felt like the movie to me so this is in my bag now all the time as well i hate to be without things like uh because then the ideas and the thoughts just disappear you know i don't want to miss anything i think i underlined something the other day conversation should be like juggling up go the balls and the plates up and over in and out good solid objects that glitter in the footlights and fall with the bang if you miss them i i like that description of a conversation  kind of speaks for itself it's tasty keeps your breath fresh and when i feel uncomfortable in social situations you know you look busy if you're chewing you know you don't look like you're just standing in space awkwardly great social tool this is the only pack of gum that i can find but i would say that i'm a five gum guy you know those massive commercials that they used to do and it's like this is what chewing five gum feels like this ridiculously physical experience that's my gum for sure  my next essential is a lamy fountain pen i didn't much like being at school and i found it kind of boring i think i found ellie on like by going out and buying the stationery that i wanted and riding with like you know stuff that was different to what everyone else had it helped me stay interested in what was happening i've gotten to a point where i really can't do script work or anything without one i can't just do it with you know a regular bic pen these are the refills of the ink and this goes with um this is a script binder that my dear friend just gave me recently and it's kind of like the hat i've been looking for for the perfect kind of leather bound script for for the longest time and this one kind of just fell in my lap which i'm incredibly grateful for usually you bring things to people's houses when they're throwing a dinner and he sort of came out of the room and he just kind of threw it on my lap and he goes i think you need this  this next essential is a pack of uh watercolors i read this book it was about like this fascist sculptor but it was illustrated by um dali and there were these illustrations that had just the most beautiful watercolors in them and i think i bought this immediately after with the idea that i have no idea how to do watercolors but in sort of those journals and stuff if i ever get bored if i do it for the next you know however many years maybe i'll like have nice paintings i love the way the colors look when they all start to bleed like this you know and it makes me look way more serious than i am when you see this  my next essential is a uh a bandana or a face covering this was before before covered this like the hat i searched for the perfect bandana it needed to be old but not you know like super used and gross and i found this in paris it's also fun to play with you know if you get nervous and also my friend alex fitzallen taught me something if you don't have a belt you can put this through the belt loops and then you tie it in a knot and it pulls the the pants together so if you're ever without a belt get a bandana  my next essential couldn't be here because she has a very busy schedule but it's my dog leila she's a one and a half year old golden retriever she speaks about 500 words of english she's a genius she feels shame she feels happiness people say that dogs don't smile and if they smile they're in pain but this dog literally has dimples when you wake up in the morning and you say good morning julie give her a little you know a little
GQ Videoseries,she comes and she wiggles up and her face curls up in the corners she's my best friend she's my comfort aunt i run lines with her that dog's my rock she's so special to me um yeah she really is not i don't know what a deal is i think she might be like an alien or something because she's um she's in touch she really is thank you for watching and listen to me talk about my stuff i appreciate it and cheers
GQ Videoseries,I don't lose or break my moscots and I do with all my other sunglasses and I don't know if that's the way they're made I don't know if it's my attitude to them or maybe what I think is probably most likely is that they just have magical powers hi GQ I'm Taryn Edgerton and these are my essentials  you get asked quite often what are your vices what are the things you spend money on and for some people his cars luxury vacations or beautiful clothes mine is candles Elton John introduced me to this candle Elton has this specific fragrance burning in any room he's in and somehow he manages to get them burning in the room before he arrives unfortunately I don't have elton's money so it's a big incentive for me to keep working this candle should come with a Barry White mixtape because it is a very that's quite a sexy smell so it kind of smells like quite tobacco in I think it might be like a bit Sandalwood like smells like magic might happen tonight [Applause]  this bracelet was given to me on my 30th birthday by Legend Lyricist Bernie tolpin we were still promoting rocket man it was in November of 2019 and he was kind of infuriated that no one had told him it was my birthday so he pulled it from his own wrist and gave it to me and told me that he'd been wearing it for decades we were in the middle of telling the story of his life as well as Elton John's and he was pleased enough and proud enough to give me this off his wrist and so I treasure it some people can wear clothes and jewelry and just own it instantly and I don't always feel that way but there's something about this I think because of the story behind it I feel very comfortable in it and I feel like it's mine and I feel like I wear it because he gave it to me  my beach film the first
GQ Videoseries,I do before bed kaytranada is quite a good guy bad music sleepy music would be like Nick Drake for the next level there's something about this specific speaker it looks kind of bashed up but it still works beautifully and it's got like this rubber strip around it which means if I drop it because I'm tearing up the dance floor in my hotel suite I know it's gonna bounce back foreign  large slash extra large baseball cap yeah I mean I'm not famous enough to forever be being handed by people but there's something about a baseball cap that makes me feel like I just can disappear and it feels like a suit of armor and obviously you know every every second day is a bad hair day so it helps with that too I've worn one for as long as I can remember normally in Navy sometimes in Black if I'm feeling dark and edgy you know not having that would make me want to turn around and drive back to my house even if I left 30 minutes ago  I love this cardigan by an LA based company called elder Statesman I have a couple of these in these really funky colors I mean it's the kind of
GQ Videoseries,that I might wear out about in LA but in London for some reason I don't know what it is but in London I feel too like I'm peacocking because they're quite loud and I feel like in LA people are much less judgmental about that but in London I always feel more of a pressure to just be kind of to be cool and be you know anyway I have three in my house and whenever my mother or my stepfather or my little sisters come and stay they always get commandeered and they sit and chill and watch movies in these so I'm forever picking out little bits of sticky popcorn from them hey that's the Perils of having your family comes to stay a couple of things in my list are maybe a little bougier a little more fancy than I actually am so I'm glad these are here because I feel they're kind of more reflective of who I really am they're like a great basic sneaker I love the humble Nike Blazer I also like a flat bottom sneaker I don't like it when there's like curvature at the side it looked great on some people it just doesn't look great on me I really feel like if they're a box fresh pair they can look quite smart but they also age beautifully I did have a real Rough and Ready pair that I was too embarrassed to bring today because I don't know I normally travel with a pair that's like a newer pair and then a pair that looks more tired as well depending on what I'm gonna wear it with these are moscots and I have like a lot of pears in this shape in different colors different tints and I just think they shoot my face and it's not the case with all sunglasses you know that
GQ Videoseries,where you're in the store it's a bit like when they put the Sorting Hat on those kids heads just instantly puts them in the right house sunglasses like that for me and a lot I don't feel good in but I always feel good in a pair of muscles I don't lose or break my muscles and I do with all my other sunglasses and I don't know if that's the way they're made I don't know if it's my attitude to them or maybe what I think is probably most likely is that they just have magical powers foreign learning about myself and my relationship with clothes like when I try and do like fashion it doesn't work I always feel almost happy and most comfortable in things that I feel are timers and the classic white tea Allah James Dean or Marlon Brando like I am not comparing myself to those guys but aspirationally that's what I'd be aiming for this is specifically a sunspell it's a British brand in a cut they called the Riviera which was I think it was designed for Daniel Craig for one of his first out of things as Bond I'll either wear a medium or a large depending on whatever else I'm wearing and how many burgers I've had that month  this is actually not something I really like about myself but I just can't sleep without an eye mask don't know what it is don't know when it started sometime in my 20s but I really struggle without it now I don't know if it comes from sleeping on planes or life of an actor you know not often being in your own bed they have short lives that I mean I slept in this one last night this is an art Department it really is this scruffy and and fatty and disgusting I will have a fresher one soon  Armani blue is my the fragrance that I wear all the time I don't have like one that you know some people have like an evening every day I just wear my blue it's it's like fresh and citrusy but it's also got an evening to it this is a bit of a name drop it was first sent to me by Roberto Armani and I hasten to add I am not paid by Armani I really do just love the fragrance it's not something I wear every day because there's something quite elevated about a fragrance I think and I can smell it on myself but sometimes it's also nice to be a little bit extra and when I want to be a little bit extra I wear a money blue thank you for having me GQ I hope you've enjoyed watching and listening to me talk about my essentials

GQ Videoseries,that my parents told this set was like he always spills on himself make sure at lunch to put a robe on him and have a Tide pen with him so you can clean up his because or his men sorry one time I was at dinner I finished my meal whatever it was all clean and my family was like wow like you finally are clean you didn't spill anything on yourself and I got up and I turned around and my entire back was drenched in chocolate sauce like the whole back and the whole chair was like sticking and the waiter was amazed he was like how did you do that how did you get it on your back after that is that's when the Tide pen came in it's gotten me out of so much trouble on set because I don't have to face the Wardrobe yelling at me I just quickly pull this out I clean it off and it's gone It's Magic then we have this wallet I think it's pretty cool it's like a blue and red Louis vuon wallet and on the back it says have a Vuitton day I don't really know what that means but I think it's pretty cool I have so much random stuff in here I mean I have a metro card that I got yesterday I have my D credit card I have a Chipotle burrito card so I get free Chipotle anywhere and everywhere I did this ad for Chipotle I've seen like David do and these people have these cards and they were posting about it and I was like Hey Chipotle like I didn't add for you guys like I know you do those cards can I get one it took a while cuz they like specially made it with like my name on it it took them like months to send it and I was like please can you send it I just want to get free Chipotle it's always weird like when I'm checking out at the register and they're like oh what is this and I'm like well it's like from Chipotle like it's all free and they're like what I just got it in January so so I haven't had it for when I was filming but next season when we're filming people will be lining up obviously I have to include my phone here my case is like disgusting it's like falling off this is the 11 Pro Max so I'm like 2 years behind but how could you not include your phone I mean my phone is like everything and I hate to say it but it is like I my whole life is on here I document everything I do so I use the camera I keep in touch with my friends I've actually been seeing some like stranger

GQ Videoseries,that got me to this place right now raising in the sun which is a script i used in college and you got like all the notes and uh my highlights this one i knew i wanted to act so this book means a lot to me prior to doing the raisin i was actually majored in business and going into my senior year that's when i switched my major from business to theater this is when i knew that i made a good decision after the second night i believe i went to the lobby and i got a standing ovation in the lobby the feeling of just that i was able to touch people and affect people i think was really what i fell in love with thank you lorraine hansberry for writing such a beautiful story from mr john c riley himself dr jerry bust it's a replica of the actual lakers 1980 championship with love from jcr just being a a part of such a great group and a great cast and a great crew the ring shows that you know we won the championship because we was the best it's the best show on tv right now i'm biased but i said it so that's what i feel this right here is getting inside the mind of a young quincy when i really got into acting and start understanding the craft of it and again just my thoughts and all the plays that i was able to see in college that i was able to use as fuel to get to this point after i graduated college i moved out here to l.a went on auditions a lot of auditions most of the stuff that i actually booked was unpaid luckily i was able to get an agent using those reels this journal shows when you focus on the work that's where you can not be scared of like what's gonna happen when i look through this journal and just like see where my thoughts were and where my head was during this time i set myself up to get to this point and i'm not gonna let myself down without uh without a fight this journal actually lives in my nightstand right next to my bed i don't i don't look at it that often but i know it's there it's about setting goals and and figuring it out from there [Applause] what do we have here moisturizing lip balm playing magic they ask me to like smile a lot naturally i smile a lot anyway but when you when you playing magic you gotta smile a lot bigger and when you smile your lips can crack sometimes to keep the lips nice and moisturized so they don't get chapped i thank you burt's bees for keeping my lips from bleeding on my co-stars this might be one of the most important items on the list because it holds all my other items my bag somebody got it for me when uh we came back for season one to shoot the rest of the nine episodes so we shot the first episode in 2019 shot the last nine in 2021 and i didn't think i would use it because like i love bags like i love a good backpack a strong sturdy backpack but i was like maybe it's a little too flashy but then i started using it and i was like nah it's just flashy enough so i get compliments on it all the time it's my travel size smell good bond number nine i was actually uh dating somebody and i was told that i needed a signature smell i can't get enough of it and i hope that they send me some more i really enjoy it and it's from new york i love new york i hear i give really good hugs and i think this has a little bit of something to do with it so it's my epic curing for my face without being uh compliments you're glowing like what's happened i try and use it every day uh wash my face get out the shower i spray my little mist and close them pores and then i slap this on there my skin carrying routine has definitely evolved much like my smell good game take care of your body you gotta put lotion on your hands put moisturize on your face put deodorant under your arms i've grown in my skincare routine and i have a lot of people to thank for that one of the main ones was uh corinne she was the makeup artist on our show and like my face would break out a lot and she got me this stuff and this is what kind of helped clear it up and i've been sticking with it ever since we got some knowledge this is the book that i'm currently reading this is one that i'm really trying to sit down and break into it's told me how to take things personal some people have bad days and some people have good days and regardless of how they treat you is is not a reflection of you is a reflection of them and where they are in their life i can't even speak to that on uh the show first episode devon nixon playing his dad norm nixon whooped magic's butt in a one-on-one game and i felt like i was getting my butt hooked and i didn't like that feeling i didn't take it personally and i understood that it was about to work it's another gift i got from my nutritionist water bottle stay hydrated especially when you out here moving around and 14 hours on set it's good to have one of these close by i notice if i don't drink enough water i'm not focused you can use it as a weapon if need be it keeps your water nice and cold or nice and hot depending on how you like

GQ Videoseries,is i like the mood in a room to feel a certain way i found this perfumer in london and the story that they told me is that she makes individual sense for johnny depp whenever he plays different roles and so he'll have a specific scent for the role i don't know if it's true i haven't corroborated that but i like that story i had a time where i was doing the iceman coming to new york i had this oil that i put on before every every time i walked out on stage and something about just whether whether you're smelling something or hearing something or um or feeling something there's ways that you you just can trigger a mental state it's almost like pavlov's dogs you know where you kind of you can trigger something in yourself so my next essential is uh is a good pair of vintage boots these i found at a vintage store in new york and i just tried them all and uh i've got some others that are you know that this part comes up further but these are just so comfortable and then i ended up watching uh fight club one day and seeing tyler durden i'm i believe he's got the same boots uh in in uh one of the scenes and he wears them unleashed and i thought it made me like him even more i never know until i try on a boot but you know some just they feel right when you put them on  all right so what we have here our next essential carhartt jacket i've got these in a number of different colors it's nice to have it keeps you warm i just yeah it's such an essential piece for me i i found my first jacket i was in my mid-20s and i was in new york and found a vintage one and had some at some spot in brooklyn and just feel good on you know to keep you warm i like the canvas you know feel to it and then as they get worn in they just feel better and better it's like boots you know and they just they start to feel like a piece of you i went through a period of wearing a car high jacket every day and and uh yeah even in the summertime i mean people would think it was ridiculous but i just it it starts to feel like a security blanket you know  all right my next essential is a good journal this is a moleskin i have so many of these i've got bookshelves full of four of these from over the years i i use it trying to work out my own thought processes whenever i get a new notebook i end up feeling a lot of pressure when i when i christen the first page usually my handwriting is really beautiful on the first page and i'll start with a poem or something like that and then and then progressively it becomes just a stream of consciousness actually reading matthew mcconaughey's book is he talked about not just writing when when you're sad not just writing when you're feeling depressed or anxious but but also making note of the times when things are going really well and it's that way you can look back and say how what was i doing at that point in my life that made me feel empowered or grateful or whatever those things are so i've been trying to employ that a little bit more  so my next essential is not just water because we can't live without it but a good container to hold it in i find that if i'm active i am drinking a lot more water when i go through lazy periods then i'm not yeah i've been trying to be more active lately so i've been i've been really trying to be better about it but you know some days i i get to the whole day i realize i've had three coffees and no water and that's not good all right so that's it these are my essentials thank you gq thank you for everybody who watched and i hope you have a good day
GQ Videoseries,i love this sound hello jq this is tromme and this is my 10 essentials  so one of my essentials is one ring it's called the clue from cartier some years ago i just wanted to have a little bit of jewelry on on my hands kohli my wife decided to offer me this beautiful ring for my 35th birthday yeah i love it it's in pink gold and yeah i wear it on this finger and it's beautiful also cartier invited me for the next med gala in new york so it's uh something for me especially for my wife to be honest because every year my wife is watching the med gala i watch it too but but not as involved as my wife and i'm really proud to be there i hope it's going to be fun but i'm sure it's going to be fun so my next essential is a gift from giaziro cult watches company i received it i don't remember i think it was in 2015 or something it's uh the reverse reverso it was made for the apollo players you can reverse it so that's the reason why it's called the reverso and it protects the watch actually while you were playing polo it's an expensive watch and uh i really wanted to keep that my entire life and give that to my son one day and say okay you know i wore this this watch and and and i'm so proud to give that to you you have to wind it manually and there is a beautiful sound which is i love this sound my corda sote in french we say it's a jump rope i just learned the word thank you for the english courses yeah that's my new routine before going on stage uh 10 minutes or 15 minutes of jump rope to be just fresh hot and do my best i feel fresh i don't know to have a second breath that's really good to uh to warm um yeah my muscles a little bit before going on stage because i love to dance yeah i have to be ready to go on stage and that's the best way to be ready so another gift from my wife is my beautiful backpack every time i go on a trip uh yeah i i take this this bag uh to have all my items my 10 essentials yeah i think it's beautiful i we bought it she bought it sorry uh in bruges it's a city from belgium it's like it's called the small venice it's not like venice in italy but yeah there is a lot of water in the city and we went there uh as a romantic trip and she bought me this beautiful bag it's funny because she checked that out on internet she wanted to buy it and then we just passed by the shop and i said well i love this bag and she said you know what i just wanted to give you to to to offer that that bag for your birthday i was so happy i don't know if it was for my birthday i think it was for christmas it was for christmas  you know when you don't have lotion on your skin you you gray oh you say ashy thank you very much for that so yeah lotion is really important for me my wife made me discover this brand it's a french brand really natural natural ingredient um really good for your skin that's really good it's really important for me to start the day to have a good lotion uh that's really important to be in a good mood that's i'm not i'm not joking that's really important for me i bump into this this sneaker when i was looking for sustainable brands on the internet and i discover a sustainable version of the sneaker so i bought it and it was really comfortable so i bought a new one and i love the color of this one like pastel colors and they are so comfortable and i love yeah i love wearing this i was a little bit extremist back in the days because i was trying like to have an entire life like it's completely sustainable but i realized that it's not possible you know you can't be like perfect so i'm just trying to do my best and that's something that we do with our brand sustainability ethic recycled materials as a consumer i try to be a good consumer too so i try to do my best but i can't be perfect so so the next essential is my uh mini keys that's something else that we that we do is collaborations and one of the collaboration was a a car that we designed with mini an electric car uh that we released uh one year ago coralie luca and myself were working with the graphist we have a beautiful pattern on the on the roof and the logo somewhere on the car and we decided everything like the color of the car and everything i couldn't even imagine to design a car one day in my life they proposed us to work with them so that was pretty obvious for us to just try something new a new experience mini so one of my essentials is at least one piece of the mossad collection so mossar is the brand that we launched with my wife and my brother in 2014 and so that's one of the piece this is simply the logo one beautiful cloud with blue green and pink i wear always at least one piece of the mossad collection to be honest i'm not the designer it's my wife corelli parpie i think that's a way of expression and that's something i love to do this is another design from my wife also and it's funny because we were just discussing about that yesterday because we don't follow the seasons and everything you know we don't want to do like just for doing stuff we have to be uh yeah convinced it has to make sense and uh we were just thinking about it that's some stuff that i love to do discuss about clothes closing lines sustainability a lot of things it's a hair ties you don't call that elastic elastic too okay so that's really important for me now because i have long hair i let them grow since 2015. if you meet me in the street like you see me in the street i'm always wearing a bun it's a difficult job and especially for the long hair every time i have to go on set for here for example i have to work with the hairstylist for half an hour i'm lucky because i have a hair stylist but actually when you don't you have to do it yourself and that's difficult so the next essential is a notebook pretty new i just bought it in cvs the other day it's not the same putting something on your phone and writing down on on notebook in a notebook it stays longer in your brain i think when you write it manually and it's so easy to have a note in uh on your phone that you have like thousand of of it and you never go back on it to be honest i'm lost in my notes on my phone so i decided to buy the new a new real notebook let's do an ad for apple yeah that's the most important object of my professional life i would say i made my entire album on this computer so i do my produce my my my beats on a program called reason by propellerhead actually i have two moods like the composition mode is i'm completely focused like working on my compositions from nine to five and that's it i do no promotion no concert then uh the album is done and then i start to do promotion interviews and and concerts and i try to compose but it's it's not the same mood and i'm not as as inspired as the in the period of composition because i think to have something interesting i need more than six months of trying having bad productions and thanks to my brother i know that it's bad because sometimes you're convinced that it's really good but actually thanks to your good friends or your creative director you learn that it's not really good for example for for multitude i wanted to have a lot of influence from traditional music from all around the world and at the very beginning it was a little bit too calculated to uh not natural and then after one year when you get used to it when it goes like completely natural it's it goes more i don't know good uh just good spontaneity spontaneous sorry yeah yeah it's more spontaneous because at the very beginning it's not it's not natural and and after one year like trying and trying and trying it become spontaneous thank you gq and see you next time bye

GQ Videoseries,is so that you can do the bone holder who knew could do a face time you could do a tick tock you could do anything really i basically never don't have one i always have one of my purse or my luggage and i have like literally one in every single room in my house ah
GQ Videoseries,is a great jacket now i know that this looks like a duvet cover it is in fact a gorgeous jacket not to name drop but it is missoni and also not to double name drop but i saw that bretman has this same jacket oh my god i run very warm so i'm not someone who can just like wear a jacket because it's cute if it's hot outside you know who can though caramel it will be 127 degrees outside and he's like let me put a bomber on it and a hat i literally in the pan dum dum have been able to escape the cove in 19 you know what i did not escape was coveted 65 which is when you gained 65 pounds from eating so much at home i couldn't stop making chicken fajita casseroles i couldn't stop making cakes pies cookies i realized halfway through the pan dum dum that none of my jeans fit anymore and so i just started wearing t-shirt dresses and i know that they're gonna fit again like everything's fine and even if they don't it's also still fine but this is just like this great t-shirt dress it's really cute so comfortable there's pockets it's a good price point i just love a great t-shirt dress it gives you like substitute teacher but with style that's my truth guess what my first sentence was anyone guess you're not gonna guess my first full sentence was no buttons no snaps no zippers i hated to feel bound up so what i've always loved is a great pair of tights they just made me feel like i was like betty aquino they made me feel like i was carrie strug they may feel like i was kim's a mess goal which are all very famous gymnasts from the late 80s early 90s and i also like this like big thick band on the top because it just makes me feel just all looking sitting pretty you know what i mean very versatile very like day-to-night simple great stun you can put a t-shirt dress over it you can put a skirt over it you can really do so much with a great pair of tights herbivore coconut milk bath soap dicks this is how we show things on youtube it's really gorgeous it looks like contraband on an airplane but it's really not you can just really sell the coconut it's so stunning but here's why i love this stuff i love baths generally speaking but i hate feeling like dried out afterwards so this coconut melt bath is really like assuaging to the skin it feels really moisturizing when you get out of the bath you have to put on a bunch of lotion i love taking baths because there's just something about a bath that feels very relaxing it feels intentional especially when you add something like a nice bath soak in it whether there's like the aromatherapy aspect of it or like the skin conditioning aspects of it i also like that during a bath you could just throw on a face mask you can multitask and i also full disclosure was going to show you this other stuff called pure soma which i also love maybe you could like fly in a graphic or something i'm also obsessed with it but i did forget that back first of all can we talk about these colors gorgeous this is jvm hair this is like my baby and when people ask me what my favorite

GQ Videoseries,sometimes people will ask me what i call myself am i a stunt man am i a comedian am i an author an actor and you know what i am i'm an attention hey gq i'm stevo and these are my absolute essentials let's get into it  i'm a real road warrior so i go everywhere with everything i need and this carry-on luggage [Applause] i could very easily replace but what i cannot replace and i cannot live without is this back scratcher i got it at whole foods in maybe 2009 my body's generally becoming decrepit so i can't reach areas where i have itches and then the back scratcher is just super important to me i could never replace it it's the greatest back scratcher of all time out of fear that i may lose it i've tried to replace it and there just isn't one out there that can do the trick my travel water pick for all my years of hardcore partying and drug abuse i never took care of my teeth and gums and i ended up with all kinds of problems there was a time when i got in the jackass van and we man said oh dude stevo your breath and knoxville said saying stevo has bad breath is like saying we man is short so this
GQ Videoseries,is absolutely crucial here's how it works  it blasts all this stuff out from in between your teeth which would go rotten and stink so i count my water pick as toiletries which are very important to me i've got my toiletry kit right here and when i check into a hotel room on the road i then take a picture of my wiener in the mirror with the toiletries and i send it to my girl and among my toiletries i have an absolute essential in my hill planner it's called zoloft man  i went to therapy back in 2013 and this therapist was telling me that he feels that i have like a lot of anxiety and that zoloft would help me and i'm like dude i'm a clean and sober guy you know i don't take drugs turned out the therapist was a clean and sober guy too and i just decided to humor him i've since found that zoloft really helps me if i stop taking it my mind can go to super dark places if i am taking it like full steam ahead baby  gonna have my speakers you know it because i got a rock i'm not gonna count these speakers as essential because they're so replaceable but i do love them because they've got these marks when i would do meet and greets after my shows on tour i pull out a marker to sign stuff and i would push it in jam it on there so every one of these dots represents a different show on tour you know i i will count the speakers as essential but they're just not that sexy what second what i really think is essential is the markers i travel with markers are totally essential to me you know i'm big into signing my merch i'm ready to do it with white paint pen with black marker with silver i'm so proud of my autograph i practiced my autograph for years before anybody wanted it and after signing it for the longest time all of a sudden i realized that when i write my signature i'm actually drawing a penis i mean it's fascinating i gotta show it i gotta show you got a piece of paper  yeah and if it's a really important autograph then i'll do hashtag dickograph this is for you guys i'm an attention and i gotta be ready to film attention seeking behavior at all times that's three different 4k cameras and i'm ready to load up big memory cards and then back it up on the hard drive and then in virtually real time edit it on the computer two really killer what i operate with is a full-blown studio in my backpack safe to say that camera stores are my happy place just had a really great experience at a camera store in washington dc on the same day that i got arrested for climbing on the lincoln memorial  years ago my tour manager said you should come out with your own hot sauce because you just love hot sauce so much and i was kind of resistant to it but then we decided to give it a shot and we came up with stevo's hot sauce for your butthole we tried all different recipes and combined multiple ones of them there was the xxx habanero i really liked but also the habanero garlic they had to go together so technically i'm a chef the other flavor that we just came out with which is called stevo's butthole destroyer hot sauce the top three ingredients are the three hottest peppers in the world scorpion ghost and carolina reaper so that's what's filling up the bottle but people are buying it  candidly my diet's kind of all over the place being sensitive to my nutrition needs i'm counting this as totally essential it's called athletic greens ag-1 this is how i start every day i meditate in the morning i get water to hydrate and i pour into the water my athletic grains ag-1 and it's great because i can do it on an empty stomach it gives me all the nutrition i need i can feel good about eating like a jerk for the rest of the day and it's actually delicious too and they're not paying me to say that right now so when i finish my athletic greens in the morning now i'm hydrated and i feel good about just pounding coffee so i fill up this 24 ounce thermos  oh man this is up there on the essentials dude plus this one in particular i've managed to not lose through months of touring what i love about it so much is that it's got this button which is like a trigger you know it's not gonna spill unless you pull the trigger so that's nine and now it comes down to the most magical essential of them all when my wonderful wendy from peru i actually found her in the streets of peru the video i made of bringing wendy home from peru got more views than any video i've ever put on the internet that's a real kick in the nuts but she comes with me everywhere she's a bona fide legit service dog she's with me on every airplane she's with me on every tour date she actually performs in my show i mean she's just a phenomenal dog i mean she's extraordinary she's a belgian malinois and evidently xanax mix so there we have it folks i cannot live without these items and your attention means the world to me so thank you for watching and man take care of the ones you love dudes

GQ Videoseries,i usually do on sundays in fact when we were in the deep part of the lockdown everybody was locked down at home i would do the dance with john's on sundays on my instagram and i would dance with people from all over the world for hours at a time and i would just have my head wrapped because the sweat coming down into your eyes you'd be on on your live and you look like you've been um doing the l i don't smoke by the way i don't endorse that for the kids watch it and then basically a foam roller you can get any kind of generic foam roller i'm just like trying to stay loose and stay in flow state all the time so you got to roll it out oh so i'm one of those dudes i like to read a few things at the same time a very associative thinker i like things that falling into the other pot and then you see what you're cooking later on when you make the connections yourself the subconscious is always working and i'm writing a symphony that's going gonna premiere next year at carnegie hall it's very big deal for me because it's it's it's over 200 musicians it's not just the orchestra it's the first black orchestra feature that carnegie hall in the history is marching band and chorus and my band and i'm conducting and i'm playing and symphony is called american symphony so right now this is what i'm dealing with so this book by howard zinn is something i'm reading right now as i'm editing and finishing the piece it's a favorite of mine a people's history of the united states 1492 to the present and just the perspective whether you agree with his perspective or not just his way of telling the story and conceptualizing it and the people that he remembers in the story that aren't often remembered is very inspiring when trying to conceptualize a piece like the one that i'm composing prince this is about his process i got a chance to meet prince and play with him when i was 19. ever since then i always have been enamored with his process you know him as an artist him as a performer it's all great obviously but the process is really interesting when you're in your own process i like to take things that i like from other people's process and you know leave the things i don't like but in leaving you've defined yourself and then this is another book about process process of film scoring when you're talking about orchestra you're talking about film score and i will say that this by earl hagan is one of the definitive books for anybody whether you want to be a composer for films you want to work in orchestras you want to work developing themes then this is they're like five composers who when i'm working on something or when i'm just looking for inspiration i'm playing the music or i'm listening to the music beethoven is one of them this is a book of some of his sonatas you know if you come to a show of mine if you see me sometime around the piano i'm liable to play one of these five composers including beethoven just messing around with it taking it apart putting it back together finding ways to just like figure it out and get to know these people better because they're not around but i believe we are with them when we play their music so speaking of music this is my next essential and you may have seen me play it before goes by many names melodica melody horn harmona board that's what i like to call it harmonica and the keyboard put together it's one of my favorite things because it can go anywhere that i go i can't take my piano with me everywhere but i can take this with me and it's one of those things that i've done for many years even when i was first coming into new york as a teenager and moving around the subway i would play it and people would start seeing me on the subway and they would recognize me for for being the kid that's blowing that
GQ Videoseries,that they want me to stop playing and then things changed and they were like can you play it and then now i'm playing it on tv i just like how averse to pomposity it is it's a kid's toy and it's not meant to be played like a serious instrument but  [Applause]  i think the phone is it because man steve jobs wow i don't i don't really use a laptop anymore i don't really mess with email if i didn't have this phone i probably would be unreachable you can go and listen to or research or basically consume anything at any time it's crazy it's addictive as well so i would advise also having time where you don't have it but it's essential when you need it that was it everybody it's john baptiste thank you all for letting me share my essentials with you i see you down the road maybe at carnegie hall if you practice practice practice

GQ Videoseries,it's basically like playing like uh on an xbox or whatever but you can be sitting in the van on the way the airport or on the plane you actually also have like a huge advantage using this too playing online phone games because most people are on their phones clicking but you have all these i just love it so much this is a super super super fire have you ever like thrown that out of anger cause then i'd be throwing my phone now controllers on the other hand i've thrown controllers for sure but that's just because i want to win man and then it doesn't happen you know you just get get a little upset and now my legs essential stuff puffs these are the big bites they already have the chocolate inside of them for example this is s'mores this is rolled in like graham cracker with the chocolate inside so it's like the samoan bite this is the uh the birthday cake so the inside isn't chocolate it has like that funfetti type stuff and then there's the cookies and cream everybody loves these i eat a little bit too much of them you can melt them down and make rice krispies treats with them i've done that personally anything you want you make cookies with them rice krispies anything there's so far love them  rx nut butter it's a pretty wild name but it tastes super super super good i put this on everything i can either with fruit uh it's a great snack and it'll like fill you up too so when you need to eat quick it's good with calories and stuff like that so i'll just eat it straight as well this is like an everyday
GQ Videoseries,legit they have some other flavors but this is my main definitely my main one right here i have like a stockpile at my house  hot sauce in general but this specific hot sauce torch bearer it's super super super spicy but i love it i actually put it on pretty much everything that requires hot sauce you know it obviously hurts with spicy stuff but i like i i don't really like the feeling but it's like super intense so that's it's fun i was in north carolina on tour when i first started touring went to this place called buffalo brothers they had this wing chart right so at the top it was ludacris and we were with the whole tour all sitting around a table and i was like and a lot of us on the tour team we all are like down with hot sauces we send each other like hot sauces hot sauce pictures make our own stuff like that and we're like oh yeah we're gonna take a little chris they're like are you sure we're like yeah they're like okay we're gonna go get the waivers that you have to sign and we're like what we designed this like release form that we could eat these wings because they were so spicy and i'm thinking oh whatever they're just doing that because it's like a huge
GQ Videoseries,but no as soon as they put down the wings and it was like i i didn't even touch him it was like everybody's getting mace like you couldn't like open your eyes you couldn't like breathe it was crazy and uh we all did it and that was easily the spiciest
GQ Videoseries,i've ever had  all right so for my next essential would be amiri pants i could have brought any amiri pants but i decided to bring the coolest ones i own right here i'm also wearing them right now they're super durable and fit great and i have these in mirrory pants and actually this whole outfit right here this is actually a one of one that mike made for me for my performance at the uefa championships for soccer he made this custom white and gray outfit for me and i'm super thankful for that and super grateful so shout out mike pretty sweet gucci guilty i've uh always worn this and you know it makes you smell good and makes you feel good you know  yeah no i don't make sense i i actually watched uzi's essential and he was like he wears one and then two and then four and i'm like i didn't even know you're supposed to mix like i just i just have the one and call it a day nothing too complicated last but not least my most let's say most essential in my everyday life my touring life everything in between is the marshmallow helmet i obviously need this everywhere i go every show i play every interview i do i've been through a lot of versions i'm obviously wearing the most recent version and this is the the version right before this one but they're still essentially the same just some different materials here and there but this is probably my ninth kind of generation of the marshall helmet as we kept going they kept getting lighter and lighter so they're easier and they aren't as harsh on my back and my neck and stuff actually the first show i had was skrillex and dj slink in new york for halloween 2015. we bring the helmet and we don't know anything i'm with i think just my manager mo and we get onto the plane and i put the i put the helmet i carry it on we get it through tsa they like scan it they're like what the hell is this i get it and put it in the overhead and it fits in fine going in and we just got it it's brand new never been worn meanwhile this this helmet was i think the helmet back then was about 13 pounds so there was like kevlar in it and like this this part was like perforated steel super heavy i put it into the overhead cool we get out i'm pulling it out and it won't get out but we really have to go i'm in a hurry so i rip it out i hear cracking all this stuff i'm like so we get out of the plane and the mouth is all the jaws all cracked all this stuff and we're freaking out we don't we don't have the money and we don't have the manpower we we can't get a helmet overnight we're like what do we do what do we do what do we do so we go to like spirit of halloween or something and we like put bandages on all the cracks and put blood all over it so it's like for halloween right and then before we could get a fix when it was november for thanksgiving we put like feathers so it's like for turkey and then for christmas we did like a candy cane with red tape and taped over we ran we really ran with that before we could get a new helmet because we didn't have money to buy another one and it was just too much right it was just too little time because i was playing so many shows you know so yeah and then uh that's a story all right that is the end of my essentials list thank you gq for having me you guys heard me talk about my wardrobe stuff the food that i eat the way that i play video games on the road the way i do my shows and yeah see you guys next time

GQ Videoseries,i'm very particular about my pens now this is not fancy but i i write with fountain pens because what happens is the tip the way you write it sort of adapts to the way you write and then it becomes your pen it's like it's sort of thinking what you're thinking if i used somebody else's fountain pen i wouldn't be able to write with it because it doesn't like the pressure you apply the way you hold it all that stuff doesn't doesn't work so a fountain pen always have a fountain pen on me oh my god i could write for hours on this if only had something to say that's the best i could do i wrote fountain pen with a fountain pen i need to change my socks okay so this is something that i've recently discovered these are called oblasts and it's a sort of a sweet wafer it can be spanish or a lot of latin american countries have it uh mexico and it's i'm gonna open it what i like about it is that it it takes a long time to eat and it makes a real mess like the texture and there's barely any flavor like this says chocolate but it's like it tastes like the memory of chocolate i've never not eaten a whole one in a sitting before if i'd started earlier i would have done the whole

stole nothing they sit there and tell you they ain't still nothing danny like whole time they know they didn't stole your charger we know kizzy this is real essential to me because you know my phone i got two phones and they always be dying i always be on my phone i'm always on my phone 24 7. everything that come through pmb come to the jack come to the phone so yeah i need my charger don't touch my charger i'm not trying to put no markings on it and none of that and make you know it's mine just don't touch it you feel me hey man my eighth essential is my lighter you know the big one can't come crack here lighter than that we call them piper strikers but this right here i need my ladder everywhere i go because if you know me you know i need the lighter quaint blank i used to be one of them balls that had like the lighter with the clip on my pants because lighter is like lighter and charger is like top two things that people are going to steal from you and act like they didn't steal nothing from you they're going to look you're going to you're going to run across your lighter with your friends at least three or four of them are going to have your lighter and they pocket and just act like it's normal for them to have it this ain't your lighter bro give me my life my ninth essential no i'm a rapper so just in case i just want to flex one day you know i'm saying i might want to go to the strip club or something like that i might just want to be generous and just bless somebody you know what i'm saying got to have them wrecks yeah i ain't gonna lie sometimes i go this is why i'll be having cash some people be like why you got cars why you got cash a lot of times i'll be traveling around and my car declined on some rare because like i'm just traveling and i haven't told my bank that i'm here and i ain't got time for this i'm coming cash you feel me we can go one way or another way or decline let me go in the bag real quick think about nothing you hear me at least got at

GQ Videoseries,i have about four more of these at home different like shapes and sizes but this is my favorite one because i think she looks really good in this one this is huge in the carpool lane this is huge what's up gq i'm noah beck and these are my 10 essentials  all right sorry dixie but this is my first true love growing up soccer was my passion transitioning from wanting to be a soccer football player to what i'm doing now it's the hardest decision i've ever had to make but opportunities were too good not to take and i kind of just had to roll the dice if you will on my future wherever i go this will always be in the trunk of my car no matter what i mean i want to do a youtube video take this to santa monica and just like pass it to people or like be like all right me and you 1v1 i think this one and the soccer ball kind of go hand in hand like the soccer ball is really there for any reason like i could play street with that i can go to an actual field but like these like determine like all right we playing for real these are always in the trunk of my car as well always i got these in paris on my recent trip and here in la fields are like scarce here like there's no fields like they're very like limited access here even if it's turf like they have it locked up and everything like you can't just go play which it's very hard to like get practice on your own but in france total opposite these fields grass turf whatever it is these fields are open to everyone and i wanted to like take advantage of that and that's been my goal since i was a kid to play soccer in europe obviously the circumstances are a little different where i was there for a fashion brand got these cleats and i and i told the brand if we have time in the morning i want to go kick a ball around like i just want to go play on one of these fields and we did played a little 3v3 against some local french kids beat them obviously soccer is kind of like my therapy have that time with their friends and just hang out play sports like that that's probably one of my favorite things to do actually of my essentials right here is my dixie pillow this was actually gifted to me by uh i'm pretty sure his name on instagram is uh the pillow guy he reached out and asked if i wanted any pillows and i said yes make me a dixie pillow it's actually funny because daisy and i both have like weird pieces of merch of each other like i have no idea where she got it but she has a dress filled with like pictures of me she has like socks with like my name on it she has like just random t-shirts saying like i'm dating noah beck it's a bit cringe honestly but it's also pretty cute i think she just came to my room one day and just saw like i have all these pillows positioned on my couch and it literally looks like i have a bunch of dixies over it literally it's kind of creepy but at the same time it's just funny and it's just like troll at this point but yeah there's about four or five dixie just sitting on my couch when she's out of town i'll cuddle up with this just as like a reminder i really need a case for it obviously because my mic falls off but uh my vlog camera everyone typically like before i even did social media when someone said like a vlog camera i assumed like very easy like a little tiny camera and like some people use that but this is my vlog camera it's kind of a heavy duty one yeah need this with me at all times in case something fun happens or in case i get an idea of just like oh we should shoot this being a youtuber this kind of just represents like putting my life on the internet if you're an og or if you remember if you i mean you don't have to be you can just go back into my feed my first ever tick tock video was filmed in my sister's room usually you would use like a ring light or some kind of lighting source i used my sister's laptop and i literally looked up white on google went to images clicked on a white screen zoomed in on it and then turned the brightness all the way up but it worked i guess and my first video did pretty well for me having zero followers woke up to like 20 000 followers so that was pretty cool that video did like 100k when i upgraded from my sister's laptop i actually went in and got a flashlight from the kitchen and like i literally put a nail right here and narrow here and then rested the flashlight on it so the flashlight was facing me on my wall it almost looked too good like the lighting was almost too good where it was kind of like creepy i'd like to say i've progressively gotten better in terms of like quality and like the production but to this day like i i i sometimes use flashlights yeah this kind of represents just like hygiene cologne i like to smell good i like to this i i didn't bring deodorant but obviously also deodorant yeah this is a special clone so i was on a tic toc live once and someone commented like what kind of clone do you use i think someone just wanted to know what kind of cologne i used and i told them i went to my bathroom and i literally showed them i was like i use like invictus paco robone or paco ribo i'm not sure how you name it and literally a week later i get a package from paco ribone and they sent me like four bottles of cologne like different like different scents from this collection this one has my name engraved into it like i didn't sharpen this on or anything like this came like this that was a cool moment i was like i'll start showing off other things on my lives too you know just get little packages probably one of my favorite compliments too is like when someone walks by and they're like you smell good next noah beck essential is just like nutrition take care of your body water is very important i drink just around a gallon a day i have this protein bar here if you need like a quick meal replacement if you miss a meal still got to get the calories in got to have your protein bar with you at all times so if you're with your friends and you guys haven't had like a meal in a while your car stops middle of the freeway let's say just having car problems they're hungry they're starving we're in the middle of nowhere i got my gym bar they don't and like if you think i'm sharing i probably will but that's beside the point like if they had a gym bar i wouldn't have to share big basketball guy love basketball it's fun to play with the friends and i'm a huge sons fan obviously pretty rough ending to the season i'm a big shoe guy big big uh sneaker head if you will so i got my purple kobe's i saw booker wearing these like they looked really good with the jerseys like the all black ones love basketball it's super fun to play and plus playing pickup basketball with like three of your friends versus three other guys like give you 30 minutes you'll burn like 800 to 1000 calories to be honest like basketball i swear just somehow you burn crazy amount of calories you're just always moving i obviously before kobe passed um was a huge kobe fan still am in terms of like his work ethic and his mentality it's it was truly like admirable the way he thought about the game it's something like even when i played soccer it's some he's someone that i kind of i idolized i love a good fitted cap i think if i'm having a bad hair day just throw this on and this is obviously arizona diamondbacks kind of hard to be a fan of them right now not having the best season but is what it is this actually has a cool story behind it because this was the hat that i wore in the mlb celeb game that i went to this year and that was an amazing experience there's usually probably one in my car you guys probably think my car is like a mess i promise you because i just said everything's in my car i promise you it's just in the trunk like i have like compartments in my trunk i'm a very clean guy i promise you that just a deck of cards cards are definitely an essential yeah this kind of just represents like all like games i'm a big board game guy i love strategy games katan i love risk there's a game called o'hell does anyone know anyone heard of that no okay game nights are one of my favorite things to do it's so fun i would take that over going out any day of the week i love hanging out with friends like fun genuine people that you just have a good time with don't think i i like have game nights with the boys with louis vuitton playing cards these were the first things i found so yeah don't come at me for that i love a good black t-shirt like i just feel like you can't go wrong you can literally pair a black t-shirt with anything a black t-shirt could be worn with jeans it can be worn with black pants it can be worn with cargo like black t-shirt like i love a good black t-shirt if i if i don't know what to wear i'll throw on a black t-shirt and just match anything with it it's casual it could be nice like you can go anywhere with that fit all right gq thank you guys so much for allowing me to share a little bit more about myself through my essentials you guys know where to follow me at noaa back on all my platforms
GQ Videoseries,that i think about whenever i'm on tour let's start with what's really essential perhaps a hug or a compliment from your father deep in meaningful relationship and friendships and a larger sense of self and purpose in this weird
GQ Videoseries,called life but for the sake of this one of my travel essentials hey gq i'm hussa minhaj and these are my essentials this is a travel kit by freegrace i've watched a lot of these things the algorithm has had a disproportionate impact on the things that i buy and i follow sports instagram pages and i always see nba players with the louis vuitton or like the prada dopp kit and i bought a cheap one from fossil years ago when i put stuff in it everything just sloshed around and i realized you need separators on my wedding day i walked into bina's room where she was getting ready and her cousin pulled out one of these and i saw all her makeup all her supplies and i was like why don't guys have this so this is it you get separation of church and state you have dividers what's really great about this this is all velcro we can do this in thirds or we can just make this a solo pocket you don't seem as impressed by this design do you understand how impressive this is this is the dob kit problem you reach in oh there's a razor blade like you don't know what you're grabbing you can hang it on a wall or when you get to a hotel you close the bathroom door and boom you hang it up again i'm a man of the people a lot of people here nick jonas will be here and he'll be like oh it's my patek philippe no no no no this is a bar of soap that i'm still using it's been on three road trips okay just irish spring and then when you're done zip everything up we're out  this is an important conversation we need to have let's talk about body hair a lot of men with melanin we have dark body hair so it's important when you get to your hotel room i bring a beer trimmer and also a body trimmer this is the beard trimmer the phillips norelco beard trimmer you can adjust the height of your beard it's really clutch what you see right here on me right now is a 1.5 or a 2. and this is the manscaped and i just like to keep it super tight you know what i mean now you may be asking why don't you do both trimmings at home i am married and i have my wife and we share a bathroom i like to treat hotel bathrooms the same way the united states treats its foreign policy i'ma get up in there i'ma make a mess and then i'm gonna walk out and act like it was never my fault this is laquinta inn's problem everybody has asked me what do you put in your hair at patriot act i used to say coconut oil and prayer this is what i actually put in my hair i'll start with a grooming tonic like this i don't know if i'm pronouncing this correctly this is the ruselle it kind of has the like that thick coconut oil type feel i'll let that sit for a little bit i'll blow dry it and then i'll put a little bit of baxter's clay pomade in there i'm damn near empty and i'm just waiting for another makeup department to come in and make it happen i have very thick coarse black hair so i use something like this i think this is a horse brush i don't know what but it's very coarse but it lets me keep the cowlicks down and we're good and once again this is not mine this was part of the makeup department  oh look at that catch this is one of my favorite brands right now in terms of shirts i was actually wearing these on stage this past weekend so if i'm doing like eight shows in a weekend what i'll do is i'll just keep a bunch backstage and then i'll just rotate through them the worst
GQ Videoseries,is if you ever watch like videos of comedians in the 90s they'll have two things they'll have a towel and sometimes they'll take the town that's like wipe sweat and i was like i cannot i cannot go full cedric the entertainer so what i've been trying to do is find a shirt that gives you buttons that makes it feel like it's a dressed up event because there's a lot of guys that are either wearing hoodies or t-shirts on stage and for a theater audience to come in it's like what are we doing here let's make this feel like this is a professional setting it's a camp collar shirt by uh saturday's new york city they have these shirts and i just bought them in multiple different colors it's really cool it has this like little like lining on the inside that feels like it's like a technical material but the material is really great it's not cotton if i sweat in it it doesn't get that like back circle so when i turn this way from the audience where i turn this way they just see this like you know to be y equals x squared yeah you don't want that this is where everything starts this is the journal of all the material and everything that i'm working on yeah i'm pretty nerdy with it i'll mark it up workshop and material stories bits things that i like and then piece by piece as the act starts to come together i'm talking to the director of my show and we're working on the king's jester we'll just start marking up each act like all right we need to punch this up we should move this section here and then what i like to do is go into google docs and then i'll just write out the entire show and this is the entire show 49 pages all the way from act one to the end of the show and then every night i'm just trying to improve different sections i'll start highlighting it and if you're wondering husson are you using your printer at home absolutely not i will go into the hotel i'll say where's the business center and can i print and color and sometimes they'll be like email us the pdf and as soon as this pdf hits their inbox i'm like you said it was okay because the look of vitriol they have in their eyes that they have to print out a 49-page document in color oh they want to kill me all my friends clown me for this i spill food on myself all the time i don't have one i have two type ends okay how to look like an adult even though you might not be one let's talk about the pen war fans of the daily show you know that jon stewart for years rocked with the classic blue bic i'm gonna be honest with you the flow of the blue bic not a fan when you pull it out dead stock yeah it's great but like a relationship that's fizzling out you pick it up day two day three day four it's not bringing it the way it used to which is why the uniball vision elite this pen is amazing what's great about it is when you put it on the paper you don't have to push really hard it's got a great flow it's thick enough to right quickly it's thin enough to still not bleed and blotch i will steal a pen from a hotel this is from the oyster point hotel from red bank new jersey i stole it this weekend i was at the front desk i said hey can i borrow a pen i didn't borrow it i took it the reason why i like writing is because it does lock in an idea the reason why i like blue specifically is you want separation and color between black text and then blue it lets you mark up and move stuff and then if i'm just doing tags or if i'm doing additional ideas that i want to add to reading i'll go with black and then when bits work i use these specific sharpies sharpie highlighters i've noticed that sometimes sharpies trying to get fancy with it they'll do a dark blue highlighter a dark orange and then when you highlight it it's it's so dark you can't even read it just give us what's most effective just go yellow  so i was wearing a timex for years and years and then i jumped into the pool the todd snyder timex collab timex that i got for free broke a couple friends cornered me and they said you're 35 years old you have to stop doing this you need to get a watch it's funny enough i was in bindi jewelers and anyone here who's from the daisy community knows you would go as a child to bendy jewelers either in the greater artesia area or in the bay area and you would go in and you would sit in the back and you would slowly cry as your mom straight up walks into bendy jewelers and and buys gold its straight up looks like indiana jones temple of doom the opening sequence of aladdin like it's they see mom's going to buy jewelry for weddings and or other events so they can flex on other aunties and you would just sit there as a kid one day i came of age i walked into bendy jewelers and as soon as i walked in they said where's your mom and i said don't worry about it simba has come back to pride rock to buy his own piece i bought this omega speedmaster i always was a fan omega specifically from the first james bond movie that i watched with my dad which was the pierce bros and gold knight and he was wearing the seamaster in it and if you remember at the time fossil ended up ripping off that watch and that was one of the hottest watches in eighth grade so i had a blue fossil that looked like the omega sea master and so before i walked into bendy jewelers i told my wife bina i was like what if i get the sea master and you get the constellation and she goes no i don't want that and so the second best choice to me was the speedy it's the moon watch i like the new one the vintage ones kind of feel lighter i wanted it to feel heavier and and kind of beefier and and i'm really happy with this so shout out to bendy jewelers i am an adult now this is the apple watch i have to set an alarm early in the morning my wife sleeps next to me and i used to have one of those old school alarms that would go off and go 4 30 a.m get to laguardia and bina's like stop so i actually got this not for any other technology but to just have like a beeping vibrator on my wrist it just beeps it vibrates i'm up it doesn't wake her up and i'm off to the airport so it's just for that  when you're traveling what i like to do is keep three pairs of shoes i have two for stage and alternate and then a gym shoe the gym shoe doubles for two things you get to wear this in the airport and you can wear it to the gym shout out to kobe this is the kobe 5 pro tro great gym shoe it's low cut it looks like it's a running shoe it's a basketball shoe keep your gym socks inside of them these are stance mba socks that i stole from the nba all-star game you need two-stage shoes i like a high-top i like a low top this is the nike air force one john elliott i think they're really cool just the laces on them they have this metallic lace on it they look really great the way they stacked the tongue is really cool so it kind of creates the separation just these little details i thought were really nice and the leather is beautiful some of you guys in the comments might be mad at me oh you need to keep them crispy white i'm not dame dash i don't just buy a hundred pairs of air force ones at a time i don't know who you think i am i drive a honda odyssey this to me is the shoe of the year the air jordan 3 amman manier they're my favorite shoe air jordan 3 is one of my favorite shoes the quality on these is so cool i really love hairy suede this is the era of hairy suede they're keeping that suede really hairy these days guys no elephant print they're going full hairy suede y'all and what i like to do is when you want to keep that toe box crisp what i do is i take a a pair of socks from winter 8th grade and put them in there look at these these are thick socks from old navy and just just put them in and then what you do in the heel is i put the other the regular socks i'm unstuck kissing everybody else look i can only take so many disappointments in life i don't even mess with the sneakers app anymore i'm gonna go to stockx i'm gonna pay the premium and keep it moving thank you for hanging out and thank you for watching my essentials
GQ Videoseries,next i've got my trusty air what's up gq i'm camila cabello and these are my essentials  you have no idea who i'm looking at right now so my first
GQ Videoseries,will be it's kind of two items but i think of it as one so i always have a book that i'm reading right now i'm reading braiding sweetgrass and i'm right here and it's a book about indigenous wisdom scientific knowledge and the teachings of plants by robin wall timmer and it's already like i think probably my favorite book i've ever read it makes me feel really grounded and i also always have a book that i haven't started because if i'm on the plane or if i'm somewhere usually i'll have another book if i'm closer to the end but if i finish i want to have another book already ready for me wherever i am i've tried kindles and i've tried reading on my ipad as well i guess if it was a conscious like sustainability like environmental

GQ Videoseries,essentials hey when we rap it's all fair game all right first we got to talk about asian snacks so many asian kids like myself when we brought these snacks to school we used to get made fun of right because the kids wouldn't know what they were so now we're here to demystify them let's start with pockies these are sweet they're delicious they're crunchy just the way i remembered them representation matters and it's about more than just you know actors on a screen it's about snacks it's about food it's about culture in every possible way japanese rice crackers they're like wonderfully sweet savory kind of rice cakes shredded squid absolutely delicious don't give me that look i know you give them that look right now from across the screen white rabbit candy otherwise known as da by tulle delicious iconic lemon tea drink from veda lunchbox staple and my personal favorite shrimp crackers shrimp crackers is actually exactly what i was eating when i got the call that i was gonna play chongqi i just woken up from a nap it was about 6 30 in the evening i was eating some shrimp crackers at my desk then i get a call from an unknown number in burbank california and you know my heart immediately skips a beat because i know that disney head office is in burbank had a feeling that this was going to be the call and so i i picked up the phone kevin feige's voice in the other end telling me that i was going to be shanxi and basically realized that my life would be changed forever so this isn't your average pair of scuffed up worn in jordans all right these are movie worn jordan accesses you know i'm pretty sure there is a marvel pa out there still trying to track these down but guess what on my last day of shooting i did manage to swipe them you could tell with that you know these have been artistically scuffed this is not even real dirt but i believe that these were the shoes that were worn for the iconic bus scene i split kicked two bad guys with these shoes so pretty sweet mems they're definitely gonna go in a case displayed somewhere until somebody i live with tells me that i can't keep these around anymore very shrimp crackers so very important to travel with a solid pair of sunglasses these are a pair of hugo bosses it's always a struggle for me i have a very wide face and so most sunglasses i try on are just a bit too skinny these i feel like frame my face kind of nice my favorite part is that they actually snap off and all of a sudden you've got a very distinguished scholarly look but then deal with it it seems like the more money i spend on sunglasses the faster i lose them there's just like one pair of 12 sunglasses i bought at the santa monica pier like eight years ago and that one seems to be the only one that never gets lost it happens more often than i'd like to admit i'm hoping these ones make it more than like the six to eight month mark this is bubble tea aka boba aka shinjuku naicha it is the iconic drink of asian america just like shanxi and the legend of the ten rings will be the iconic movie of asian america these are all 50 sweet still doesn't change the fact that they're uh a lot you've got things that are a little bit more milky so this is a jasmine milk tea right here you have things that are a little bit more fruity this is a strawberry green tea with a lychee jelly and you got uh some you know new flavors as well this is a milk foam winter melon drink i like a good grip with the straw you know i don't like them to be too small otherwise you know you can suck up a bunch at once i really like the one boba at a time kind of situation you just got to make sure that you cover the top and then you go in and you go in nice and firm just one two three pop break the seal stir it around a little bit and go in and enjoy that is good boba i never was a watch collector growing up my dad was never into watches i mean we literally grew up so poor and came from like absolutely nothing so i never really knew too much about watches so i really just went on the look and the feel of it one of my favorite watches to wear are iwc's this is a portrait geezer 14 karat gold this is a top gun edition pilots watch the black band this is a 37 77 pilots watch such an iconic look with the metal strap i have a couple of pieces in mind that i'd love to get my hands on but i'm also trying not to get ahead of myself too much i really just want to see how this movie does and hopefully you know get to do more and and when i get room to breathe i'll kind of take a look at the collection and see what pieces it needs this is a basketball obviously i've always been a massive basketball fan fancy myself a player shout out to all of my friends back home who i hoop with so i mean i played basketball all throughout high school was never really any good average maybe a solid six or seven points a game had big nba dreams and unfortunately at the age of 32 i feel like they're they're dashed one of the main things probably the critical factor is i never ended up growing past like 5 11 and a half but i i was like one of the bigger kids when i was 15 or 16 so i played small forward so i was this like tiny small forward but that being said the nba all-star celebrity game still very much in the cards i was actually flatmates with ronnie chang i mean he lived in the same hotel as me he was like right underneath and we would play basketball we'd play one-on-one like hours and hours a day every day and look i'm just gonna be real all right i would spot him like five points to a game to seven and i would still beat him like 90 of the time yeah ronnie chang sorry buddy sorry to put you on blast like that but uh come on love xbox this is an xbox series x black elite controller perfect for any sort of call of duty halo i mean i love all of that i love playing 2k so this is an absolute travel must for me it looks like the lamborghini of video game controllers like the first halo came out right when i was like around 14 years old and we literally played it all the time like me and my three friends would play i still remember so clearly hang them high pistols only three head shots in a row with a pistol could kill you and that's we we got so good at it we just kept we just kept doing it there gun is really important for me whether i'm playing sports or just sitting for really long periods of time my wonderful publicist got me these two for the start of our press tour i've been pretty hooked ever since it's just really important to keep the muscles loose it's really nice when

GQ Videoseries,when i die i want these burnt and mixed in with my ashes and spread over the beach that's not true but maybe maybe we'll see  what's going on it's chase stokes and these are my essentials
GQ Videoseries,i actually have on my wrist because it's an essential this is one of omega's new watches this is the sea master and it's got a beautiful blue face rose gold omega has been so fantastic to me over the past couple press runs and allowing me to wear their pieces so this is just one of the most beautiful watches i've seen in a long time and i kind of like that the face matches the jacket yet again just a very timeless piece and anytime you get to wear something that james bond also wore kind of makes you feel good inside i'd kind of always been a fan of watches but growing up in a um not as you know well-off home it was kind of a far-fetched stream and so as things sort of started to progress in my career that was always sort of a stable piece that i wanted to have it just always kind of brings a smile to my face you know it's a reminder of the hard work that it's been over the past couple years and being able to take a step back and say okay you know like you deserve something like this or the value for the work that you've done with this show and with yourself and taking the risks that you have you know it's nice to treat yourself i don't know man you just put on a good watch and you feel good it's like putting on a well tailored suit you know you put it on and you're like well like not too bad right next up we got tom ford exfoliating scrub and this is a lifesaver for me so playing john b is great but i naturally have a little bit of facial hair so i have to wake up every morning and shave my face and i use this probably twice a week and it immediately brings my skin back to life it helps me so much with small breakouts i do have sensitive skin so this is a go-to lifesaver thank you tom ford i'm very obsessed with this product i'm going to embarrass myself right now any beachgoer is going to recognize this brand this is rainbow sandals and i've had these shoes since i was in eighth grade they're my daily drivers yes those are holes in the uh the heel areas uh the straps are basically going to come off if these things could talk i probably wouldn't be able to sit here right now with all the trouble i've gotten in in these shoes so like john b i've run from the cops in these i have we'll just we'll just leave it at that but great sandals are great for the beach they're great for basically any occasion summer i've worn them during winter months too call me crazy it's fine but they're just awesome sandals that obviously last a lifetime and the best part about them actually is this company if i wanted to right now i could send them right back and they would send me a brand new pair so super environmentally friendly i'm a big fan i actually have another pair but i just stick with these bad boys it's just one of those things that i don't think i'll ever be able to detach from unless somebody throws them in the trash like my girlfriend or my mom or my dog eats him you never know he likes to carry things okay so i lost him actually when i first moved to la i was um kind of bouncing back and forth between people's houses i slept in my car for a little while i remember i had tried to condense my entire life into my car and i'd left like suitcases or a backpack at friends houses and and that was one of the items and i remember vividly having a panic attack because it was one
GQ Videoseries,that i had had that was sort of a part of my life prior to the whole entertainment industry so i don't remember where i found them or how i got them back but it was a borderline face of tears which is super embarrassing because it's just a shoe that has holes and shouldn't be in my life anymore but here we are my next essential these bad boys amiri sunglasses i can't say enough about these the clear lenses are kind of nostalgic amir is just such a great brand he's american designer just like a really cool story la based dude and all of his stuff is just so rad so when i got my hands on these and just the way they fit my face i just thought they were a little different but different enough to fit my style i kind of like to uh try new things all the time and so what's not to love you know it is a blue tint which ironically matches sort of this fantastic jacket i do like a black frame they just feel timeless and they feel like you can just pair them with whatever you're wearing and then with a tinted lens like this with the blue it just i don't know i kind of feel like iron man and it makes my my stomach feel nice and warm so iron man watch out robert downey jr i might take your sunglasses too next essential lay labo oil diffuser sand tall 26 which is very similar to the 33 but i am a huge saint guy i have literally been putting this in diffusers for maybe two years now since i figured it out but i bring it with me everywhere it's kind of one of those scents for me that reminds me of sort of a home base and in the entertainment industry we travel a lot and being gone on location you're trying to kind of make a home away from home so scents for me are always something that brings me back to a specific moment in time and this one when i smell it honestly what it takes me back to is being on the water for some strange reason and in charleston you're constantly surrounded by the marsh so there's like a very specific scent and i guess just because of where i was in life and sort of that transitional period this was one of the first things where i wasn't buying you know diffusing oils from amazon and i decided to splurge a little bit which sounds ridiculous because it's just you know an oil but it's just been something that constantly puts me in a place of nostalgia so santol oil diffuser says i should get rid of it after 12 months but i'm gonna keep it going so my next essential is a moleskine journal i'm a big journaler in my personal life for a number of reasons um i've struggled quite a bit with my anxiety and kind of coping with that and uh one
GQ Videoseries,that i really connected with through that was poetry what i learned through poetry is if you take the time to write it on your phone you have the opportunity to delete everything and you can kind of go back and erase words and when you put it on paper it lives forever so you're kind of watching your mistakes and you're watching yourself grow and you're able to kind of jot things down that are a little bit again nostalgic for whatever was going on in that time i've gone through kind of a lot of ups and downs over the past couple years with you know family members passing away and loss and a lot of the you know accolades with the show and everything going on there so to have a physical copy of reminding myself of the journey itself and not allowing social media to be a definitive factor of where i'm at and sort of level myself and feel grounded that's kind of why i like to put it down on paper versus you know jotting it in an iphone note i've probably got 15 000 different notebooks laying around i like moleskins because they're the size of them is convenient but i have ones that say like chase's world plans and like just random you know like the yellow legal pads laying all over my house i mean i make daily notes because if i put it on my phone then i'll just kind of swipe through it so i'll even put to-do lists in my journal just because i always have it on me so yeah it looks cool this one's black it's pretty sleek i like it it's called a furminator that is a must for any dog owner it looks a little scary but i have an 85 pound puppy and he sheds a lot like a lot so this actually gets under the top layer of the coat and it pulls out all of that excess fur so this is a lifesaver i've prayed for it for a long time and i'm very thankful to have it in my life i found milo he looks like a wolf he's a german shepherd golden retriever mix he was from a farm in pennsylvania and my mom and my girlfriend found him on craigslist and i was not really looking for a dog at the time lo and behold i got bullied into it and now i have an 85 pound one-year-old dog who basically controls everything that i do in my entire life from the time i wake up till even when i'm asleep i feel like he's still controlling my brain so it's great it's a it's a good time-consuming activity shedding dog big house small house you need this bad boy one of the most essential items in anybody's list is headphones but these were a gift from a lovely friend of mine and they are the berluti bang and olsen collab and they are probably the coolest headphones i've ever seen in my entire life they are noise cancelling which is super super clutch especially for travel you know with work we have been traveling quite a bit you know we shot all through covid and having a good set of headphones when you're trying to get into character having a good set of headphones when you're on the plane and you're trying to zone out i've been big into headspace on netflix lately i put these bad boys on and literally the last i think like four or five nights i fell asleep on my couch with these headphones on listening to headspace like totally trying to get my head clear so i am absolutely obsessed with these bad boys they're incredible this is a canon 90d with a sigma 35 millimeter lens i got into photography probably about four or five years ago i tried to kind of start with the entry level cameras and as i sort of got more and more into the workload with outer banks all of our dps which is our director of photographies i just loved picking their brains so our director jonas always lets me kind of shadow and i sit next to him and i've learned so much about it so i just wanted to have a camera that i was able to snap moments not just at work but throughout life it just felt like the right size it wasn't too much of like a cinema camera it you know does great with like sort of the point-and-shoot stuff it takes incredible images and in canon i love the warm tones for them so i think this is my second 90d because i broke the other one um dropped it in the water oops but this lens sigma is just incredible and then this strap was actually a gift from maddie so it's kind of a cute little reminder of my lovely girlfriend you know i love to hate jump ropes if i'm being completely honest it's one of the best forms of cardio you can do it in a relatively small place sometimes you got to make it work so through kovid you know we didn't have gyms and we had to get really creative with our workouts and obviously doing a lot of the physical activities myself i have a wonderful stunt double named cole but i still try to do as much as i humanly can so for me staying in the best shape that i can and matching my diet with my fitness is incredibly important because we don't have a small shoot window we shoot for over half the year this season in particular we were in barbados which was on basically a full lockdown while we were there so having some form of physical activity when you're essentially locked in a hotel room when you're not shooting is super super crucial so this bad boy has served me well and uh has left a lot of welt marks on my arms and my shins and my feet as well so i love to hate that

GQ Videoseries,I would say 90% of my t-shirts that I own are black this one in particular is do gabana but I use uh Buck Mason shirts as well I think they were founded in Venice local Los Angeles brand they have a great sort of oyster cut on the back and kind of gives you a little bit of shape but they have got more expensive so you must be doing well bug Mason so this one makes a lot of noise leather jackets I am forever sort of living in leather jackets this one it's a beautiful I think it's car leather I know touchy subject but yeah I I I have a tremendous amount of sort of leather jackets everything from this one's again do Cabana Bell staff do some fantastic sort of motorbike jackets as well as sort of outdoor outdoor jackets kits that I love bar vados has a fantastic fit as well U but I'm loving these Doo right now cuz they they have a great a great fit and and great colors don't be afraid to sort of step out of the whole black leather
GQ Videoseries,go for some color spice it up my love for leather jackets I guess it stems from trying to look cool is that good enough for a reason green juices the world would be a much happier place and everybody had a green juice to start their morning this one has some cucumber some spicy stuff some ginger maybe but it's meant to sort of give you that little burning sensation in the back of your throat cuz you know it's doing good stuff whenever I'm I'm on a full day at on set I have like an endless supply of uh of green juices the trick behind making green juices semit taste good I think is the abundance of Ginger if you're putting like terrible stuff like kale in it no good spinach passable cucumber fantastic apart from that what else they put in green juices like green beans and I don't know chalula hot sauce is a must with any meal not particularly chalula I do love chalula definitely uh more so whilst moving to sort of America in Malaysia I love sambal blood which is chilies with fermented shrimp fried up and kind of mixed with delicious kind of Asian Delicacies but hot sauce wise nothing more than something that's going to burn your taste buds and destroy your meal I've made that mistake in the past one of my friends John pady his son brought out this hot sauce uh which I think is called the end I thought they were joking but they're like oh we had to like sign this waiver it was like really hot I was like yeah okay whatever we decided to sort of have a drop of of the end and I literally was in tears for about an hour just like choking my my friend had to go to hospital it wasn't a good night for for the both of us my ninth

GQ Videoseries,too you know through zoom you know speaking with our editors so for anybody at home you can make a tv show with just one of these especially when someone that makes these pays for it it makes it a lot easier and it also has you know dozens and dozens of dozens of thousands you know probably like 50 000 personal photos of all my years through snl family photos if i lost that i would be can i say the next essential that's a red pen right there your pilot g2 this is basically what i do all the notes on any hard copy of a script or anything i start with a box of these and i lose them throughout the season another red pen up in there another red pen sharpies just in case the delete key on the you know the laptop is is very functional but a lot of times i work with hard copies just because it's easier to jot down notes it's just the way i got used to doing it at saturday night live from you know people like tina fey and jim downey and you know mike shurer and seth meyers like why would i change now so yeah the pilot g2  if you do this it makes it look like it's rubber all right i've got two decks of cards in there red and blue tally hoes i like magic i like card tricks i get a lot of idle time in the world these days you know and i was like i don't just want to stare at my phone and get mad all the time i want to do something else with my hands and messing with a deck of cards was it's almost like a professional like fidget spinner to just sit there and like shuffle cards and i just like i've just kind of gotten used to like screwing with them every now and then if i've had enough beers i'll do like card tricks for friends but for the most part they're in there just to pass time in cars or on set or doing tarot card readings if you you know know the symbolism i i don't but you know i think aces are good  again you know operating out of a backpack this is kiehl's blue herbal spot treatment that's for pimples keel's like a company i feel that as a guy from the midwest who doesn't pay too much attention to the way he um looks it feels like i'm not too far off this feels like being a grown up and being responsible and like this and the face scrub that's about that's about that's about what i do and that's that's that  well here we go this is important you might know what this is it's my eyeglasses these are my glasses essential for a number of things most importantly seeing also for looking smarter than i really am i use these i am nearsighted which means i can't see far away and this is a brand called tart optical i have a lot of different styles of this exact same frame like a lot of different flavors i would say like brown and clear and you know mocha or whatever the heck these have done these have done the trick and oh oh this is being filmed oh i'll always wear glasses every time i think about doing lasik i just uh buy new like frames and and then that desire to have someone shoot lasers into my eye is is removed headphones i got you know air pods i got you know airpod pros in here somewhere i think too wait a minute do i have the airpod pros look at this i mean i've got them like airpod pros regular air pods and then the airpods max or i forget what they call these these are what i use when mixing the show because you know you want to be able to hear everything they're great they fit great they look cool phone calls i just go with the airpods and then the airpod pros are great but like i've got weird little ear holes when the

GQ Videoseries,i'm doing the essentials for gq of course what's up gq i'm camilo and these are my 10 essentials  so i'm gonna start with this one this is my journal this is the first
GQ Videoseries,i do every morning in my life like i really need to write about what i'm feeling how do i feel inside of my heart you know what i'm what i'm trying to fix in me my projects my dreams when i go three or four or five years back in my old journals and i read what i was feeling when i was about to release let's say my first song and to remember that i'm feeling the same exact
GQ Videoseries,now and how can i like like i don't want to repeat myself i want to know myself so i can improve myself like i finish one of this every let's say like two months can i have them all like in my labor i have like hundreds like maybe a hundred i think so so this is my journal journal like what i'm feeling every day but i have like a prayer journal what i'm having like in my heart and i'm like revisiting every day i have a songwriting journal which is another different one i have um a vision journal where i like write what i'm dreaming about and we visited every day so i can like that's a huge thunder second essential for sure my guitar this is not actually a guitar this is a guitar lele i'm always traveling with a different instrument not only because it's travel size but because i wanna get uncomfortable with my songwriting like when i'm writing always and just with the guitar maybe i'm gonna start repeating stuff and going for the same chords that i love but traveling with a different instrument it's like a challenge for me so i can start like following like a sound that i like right and then i start like improvising stuff beyond words beyond melodies  i'm not saying anything but it sounds great and i like it i mean i i like it boom this is essential if you have a mustache this is essential for you i've been trying every mustache walks in the world but the only one that works the beast walks i love it i cannot live without it i have to take it with my nail and then i have to warm it up right like i have to do this a hundred times and when it's like really warm you can put it there and then when it gets cold again your mustache is where it should be right so i've been in the position where i lose my mustache rocks i don't know what to do so since that moment everybody that is around me has one my wife has a much love a mustache wax my manager has one in the car in the guitar in the nylon guitar and the ukulele my photographer everybody has one because if i lose this and i don't have it i cannot fix it my mustache inspiration would be pancho vida his mustache was on point the leaf mustache was a little thinner and way longer but pancho villa was like kind of this mustache he's my mustache inspiration this is essential for me kindle the
GQ Videoseries,with the kindle is that at the beginning i was holding myself from having it because i'm a huge fan of real books and i read a lot but the
GQ Videoseries,is when you travel all the time with seven books it's like exhausting a thunder we're in the middle of that dominican republic a lot of thunders like of course there's books that i don't want to have here because i want to have them like and smell the lasso like the pages right i love that but this is awesome so

GQ Videoseries,that i've learned in my humble beginnings in my life is the people that i really respect they just have a few things they need so i'm a simple guy you know i'm a simple person so first and foremost you know got to keep the keys to the whip so i can get out the house and get in traffic and shake and move so you got to do that so you can't leave without having these so keep you some keys get you some keys if you got no keys you should have some these are the keys to my rolls royce i do have a lot of cars but you know most of the time i just keep it simple all my fleet is white i happen to like white cars you know man it goes with it goes with who i am but my
GQ Videoseries,is about class i just they keep things clean no rim factory um you know just classy you know like myself so uh yeah that's what i do on the weekdays you see me on a friday though it gets busy so rolls-royce keys right here drop the top in traffic right here on my wrist gotta know the time got ahead at rolly you know what i mean playing jane scott dweller i do own a lot of watches but i try to keep it plain as possible because you know i just feel like that's more powerful for me when you walk around and you look like it and you feel good and you can actually tell the time what you watch um i think that that that shows what type of person you are you know with it without the stone so i like to do the plain jane so gotta have that rollie how do you feel cheesy about the new wave a lot of these young guys getting the uh the resharp mill how do i feel about it i mean i i respect it you know you got to think you know when i came in the game i had every piece of jury you could name every watch there was with diamonds in it so i respect we all got to go through that phase it's a phase you know what i mean and it's like you get to your money that's how you want to spend it i respect it um you know just for me it's just like a lot of places that i go it doesn't require that but when i do pop out and i need that i got a few of those too you know what i mean but i like to do the playing j you know what i mean sometimes just keep it real clean classy as i say um classy and and that's what i'm about so shout outs out to them if they you know they want to rock the right the iced out richard mule or whatever they want to do man that's state paper and that's how they want to spin it can't leave home without my trusted computer i call this my computer right here got a picture of me and my mom's on the cover right there you know when i was a young rp mom we love you um but this is like you know coming up i wasn't like a computer head so i didn't i didn't like dealing with digits and gadgets but this can this this phone is like my computer i can run all my companies from this phone i can make sure my peoples are straight i can uh send email text what have you see what's going on in the world so it's like one of the first things i gotta have when i get up i don't look at it in the morning first because i give myself time to reset but i can't leave

cash in the duffel bags and all that but what i did learn over time is it's a lot easier so for me when i pull up and just flash the cards it makes it easy i'm to have a whole bunch of cash in my pockets unless that's something i really want to do but you can't leave out the house without this and i find myself uh more and more daily like you know really you know really appreciating having credit cards instead of walking around with a pocket full of cash jesus you mentioned bitcoin do you ever foresee a world in which you'll be like just trading bitcoin i hope not i hope not i mean i get it you know we we with it but it's like you know when you want to grab a pocket full of cash you got to have that you know you want to break out your black card is always good um again you know i'm not like a crazy computer guy so i wouldn't want to get on line to uh buy a home or to buy a car to buy some real estate uh using bitcoin i'm quite sure i can hit my and he can do that but um i

GQ Videoseries,that i've learned in my humble beginnings in my life is the people that i really respect they just have a few things they need so i'm a simple guy you know i'm a simple person so first and foremost you know got to keep the keys to the whip so i can get out the house and get in traffic and shake and move so you got to do that so you can't leave without having these so keep you some keys get you some keys if you got no keys you should have some these are the keys to my rolls royce i do have a lot of cars but you know most of the time i just keep it simple all my fleet is white i happen to like white cars you know man it goes with it goes with who i am but my
GQ Videoseries,is about class i just they keep things clean no rim factory um you know just classy you know like myself so uh yeah that's what i do on the weekdays you see me on a friday though it gets busy so rolls-royce keys right here drop the top in traffic right here on my wrist gotta know the time got ahead at rolly you know what i mean playing jane scott dweller i do own a lot of watches but i try to keep it plain as possible because you know i just feel like that's more powerful for me when you walk around and you look like it and you feel good and you can actually tell the time what you watch um i think that that that shows what type of person you are you know with it without the stone so i like to do the plain jane so gotta have that rollie how do you feel cheesy about the new wave a lot of these young guys getting the uh the resharp mill how do i feel about it i mean i i respect it you know you got to think you know when i came in the game i had every piece of jury you could name every watch there was with diamonds in it so i respect we all got to go through that phase it's a phase you know what i mean and it's like you get to your money that's how you want to spend it i respect it um you know just for me it's just like a lot of places that i go it doesn't require that but when i do pop out and i need that i got a few of those too you know what i mean but i like to do the playing j you know what i mean sometimes just keep it real clean classy as i say um classy and and that's what i'm about so shout outs out to them if they you know they want to rock the right the iced out richard mule or whatever they want to do man that's state paper and that's how they want to spin it can't leave home without my trusted computer i call this my computer right here got a picture of me and my mom's on the cover right there you know when i was a young rp mom we love you um but this is like you know coming up i wasn't like a computer head so i didn't i didn't like dealing with digits and gadgets but this can this this phone is like my computer i can run all my companies from this phone i can make sure my peoples are straight i can uh send email text what have you see what's going on in the world so it's like one of the first things i gotta have when i get up i don't look at it in the morning first because i give myself time to reset but i can't leave

cash in the duffel bags and all that but what i did learn over time is it's a lot easier so for me when i pull up and just flash the cards it makes it easy i'm to have a whole bunch of cash in my pockets unless that's something i really want to do but you can't leave out the house without this and i find myself uh more and more daily like you know really you know really appreciating having credit cards instead of walking around with a pocket full of cash jesus you mentioned bitcoin do you ever foresee a world in which you'll be like just trading bitcoin i hope not i hope not i mean i get it you know we we with it but it's like you know when you want to grab a pocket full of cash you got to have that you know you want to break out your black card is always good um again you know

GQ Videoseries,that's annoying about staying hydrated is you just like have to pee all the time it's it seems it's not very rewarding it almost makes it not worth it i'd rather just be dehydrated life was fine when i was dehydrated but i like this water bottle so i just drink from it if i ever lose it i think i will lose myself this right here is my backpack it's a st laurent backpack kind of just matches anything it's just a black backpack and it's very kind of classic and beautiful it has  several pockets i don't really carry that much with me other than just lots of trash so i've had it for a couple years now i really can't imagine my life without this backpack it's it's kind of a buddy of mine at this point it's very very sturdy and hearty it's been through a lot i don't know how it looks normal after what i've put it through again i just kind of keep things around when i like them  these are my sunglasses these are the pair that i've been liking lately but i have a lot of pair of sunglasses i kind of need them everywhere i go or else i just start crying i can't really see anything unless i have sunglasses on normal light is a lot for me i don't know who made me like this but i look outside in normal daylight and i just start crying i'm not sad most of the time i like these because kind of make me feel like an alien sunglasses are one of those things that you kind of just have to have fun with there's no point in being serious when you can't even see outside without glass in front of your eyeballs so might as well just make them kind of fun this is my sunscreen this kind of feels like a mom pick i wear sunscreen every single day i put it on several times a day because that's what is recommended i burn very very easily i'm even partially sunburned right now by doing nothing by just standing outside for like 30 seconds it's the irish in me can't help it thanks father this is a brand that i like i also have multiples of them because i'm just kind of dumb to be honest i will pack one and then i will just forget that i've packed it and i'll pack another and then i'll lose one and then buy another and then pack the other one so i have two just in case anyone watching needs one i have a lot of them i'm realizing it's probably a really lame

GQ Videoseries,is skincare first we got this hyaluronic hyaluronic hyaluronic i don't even know how to pronounce this serum the secret weapon and then we got boom the face cream for men i don't know what the difference between the one for men and the one for woman is but it says for men so i had to let y'all know and then the enzyme cleanser and you know my skins never look better i got into skincare cause my mom and my sister have like really nice skin and you know i'm in middle school i'm getting my first pimples i'm like yo how do i get rid of this and my mom's like all right don't worry i'm gonna put you on so i've always known that you gotta take care of your your face and friend of mine she knew barbara and she was like yo you gotta try these out and i'm like yeah you know i'll try it out let me see what it's like and my skin has never been so clear these are just like super gentle everything smells good like not too scented but just like scented enough to feel fresh and relaxed it's like this is a commercial me familia this is a picture of my family i think this was probably like almost a year ago wow so this is my dad this is my mom this is my sister and uh this is my twin brother i couldn't make it that day no i'm just playing that's me i grew up in san francisco california as the cardigan implies my family we've always been really close my parents are super supportive of whatever it is you want to do just be great at it and if it's making you happy it's making them happy my sister she's like a volleyball aficionado and like a genius in school i think she got like a 4.3 or something right now gpa so props to her i talk to my family like by text or facetime or call every week really like multiple times a week my mom is always hitting me sometimes you know even when i don't want her to but she stays checking in my airpods if you didn't know i make music so it's kind of important for me to be able to listen to music on a regular basis what i like about those ones in particular is when i'm traveling like on the plane or something like that i can put the noise cancellation mode in and all the crying babies all the turbulence all the you know announcements is all drowned out and i could just listen to my music fall asleep and vibe out but every time i wake up off off an airplane nap i have at least one airpod missing so i got to be the guy like at the end of the fight digging under my seat looking for that left airpod pro like help like where the flight attendants you guys help me that's me every time the only

GQ Videoseries,i put on with a sweatsuit in the middle of night and go on a mission yeah i wear these constantly i mean this is a shoe i would tap into the rest of my life about a year ago i probably wouldn't been able to bring as many things in here because you know i don't have a lot of items i feel like i can't live without i'm not materialistic but i got this recently and i'm in love with it it's a sky dweller stainless steel rolex i like the color of it i don't really like yellow gold so for me this can go with so much in the blue face like i mean especially right now this hits right now just because of my fit but i didn't fantasize about watches growing up but now that i have one i really could see myself building a collection but it's the only watch i have right now so these are condoms i really like the grip on them and they're just effective your life can go downhill without them so i really recommend these where can you buy them a lot of places pharmacies grocery stores you know it gets tougher the later at night it gets but there's a lot of options most places most places carry them there's a chance i can't live without them it's an essential at all times all locations so next i have these i got these about six days ago i really like how they fit my face there's no brand name on them so i have no idea what brand they are my friend urban gave them to me i can hide behind them in a way at the right times you know it gives me a nice like an anonymous feel like when i just want to take a walk and just be amongst society sometimes i get recognized in them but a lot of times i can slide with these and just and i feel good behind them and i've seen myself in them and i like how it looks my air purifier part of me thinks that it's been placebo for me that this is making my air better but it feels like my area has been better since i got this yeah i haven't changed this filter yet so i could be breathing in dusty ass air no telling there have been no alerts on it so i feel like it lasts a while and i like the size of it just looks like it has an effect on the room sometimes i turn it on blast and it's just this is a ring i got this about three weeks ago the championship ring and i got eight of them for my entire collective private garden that's what it says on the front and uh this was a special moment this was the first time i really iced out my collective and the guys i came up with it's just a lot of diamonds on my face and some white gold and some enamel there's a fountain on the front fountains our logo alex moss designed it out of new york it's similar to the watch i never thought i would be a ring guy but i just love wearing it i love how i feel in it i was in the gym maybe eight months ago and there was a woman in the gym selling cmos and one of the main things she told me about it is that it increases your libido and just your drive and she gave me some right there and the rest of time i was in the gym horny as hell i was turnt up i couldn't even really work out i had to go home and it has a lot of other benefits immune system support stuff like that i think it's in one of those like rainbow blossom type expensive chips with a bland bag type you know i don't know one of those stories i don't think these are like they might be a kroger but i don't know i think it's at one of those nice stores i think it's good for your body and i take a lot of it white tee i got a drawer these and i wear them at least every other day i like the way these fit these are the slim fit calvin kleins and they really grip me and make me look fit i don't spill things i haven't spilled anything since i was like 14. i love wearing white i wear white all the time i think it's my favorite color to wear i wear all white my pants are white right now white shirt you know i love white so these are scissors i use these to cut a lot of things tags um there's certain chip bags like let's talk about the veggie sticks because i knew this was gonna come up let's just talk about it the bag is like it's just like it's not built for a man to open and it's so stupid because when you do cut it open then how do they stay fresh you have to eat the whole bag right there because then it's just a torn bag and then you can't so i'll open a bag with this regretfully but i do use these to open certain like sturdy chip bags no i wouldn't trust myself to cut my hair i've never even shaved myself my mind i've shaved myself i have this hoodie can you read it it says ear ecstasy on it i don't have any article i've had longer than this i keep it tucked in my closet i don't take a lot of places because i would be devastated if i lost it and it's one of the few items i have that i feel that way about so your ex sees a record store that was around in the city i'm from louisville kentucky when i was in middle school it was right at the end of the cd era we used to go up to the store and we would buy jones soda and we would buy cds and it was just a special place and it's really a landmark in louisville history for sure somehow it still fits me i've grown a lot since middle school it was big on me then and now it's small on me now but it's always work so i treasure this for real  gq thank you so much for having me i had a great time i'm jack carlo and those were my essentials
GQ Videoseries,oh my god he just farted guys i'm embarrassed to be in front of all these people what's up gq my name is ella may and these are my essentials first off we have my phone of course i feel like in this generation and in this 2020 if you can live without your phone you are a very special person and i commend you a lot because i cannot live without my phone the number one
GQ Videoseries,i do with my phone is facetime i sometimes look at the time and be like oh it's five o'clock where did the day go and i've literally just been on facetime the whole day whether that's my mom to my brother to my best friend in new york i'm always on facetime it's terrible actually so my second
GQ Videoseries,is a diptype candle i actually only recently got put onto diptych my brother put me on but mustard actually really loves the tea candles as well this is the vanilla flavor my favorite one is actually the amber one which is being discontinued and going out of stock so i'm very sad they're quite strong in a sense of like they'll leave even if i blow the candle out i can still smell the candles but they're not overbearing if they're still subtle enough that you won't walk in my house and think that there's like a whole bunch of perfume so they're subtle and strong at the same time if that makes any sense even just like being in their store it's very clean it's very fresh and your whole house will smell amazing if you're going to dip tea i should be a sales woman this next one is the essential of all essentials in elements world i promise you wherever you go you will never not find me with five of these in my bag this is burt bee's moisturizing lip balm this one is the coconut and pear one it's actually not my favorite flavor my favorite flavor is the vanilla bean one which has a blue cap but i promise you i have every single flavor of burt's bees some people might say it feels kind of like it feels almost too thick because obviously it's beeswax it's made out of beeswax but i love everything the company also stands for they're very natural brand and it's very very moisturizing and it smells good it's subtle again it's a very subtle scent i literally can't live without it like i one
GQ Videoseries,i can concentrate on so i make sure that i never put myself in that position by moisturizing my lips please people moisturize your lips and do it with burt's bees you can find it in l7 this essential is my fenty beauty lip gloss as well as the burt's bees you always have to be moisturized underneath your lip gloss but fenty beauty lip gloss is my favorite everyday lip gloss i don't really wear makeup um i can't do it i will look like a clown if i do it myself so unless my lovely makeup artist is with me then you'll really only get like some moisturizer and some burt's bees and some fenty beauty out of me it's not too overpowering but it also gives you just a little bit of gloss other than the fact that it's rihanna's lip gloss obviously and i love her there's a lot of shimmer which i think she has on a lot of the fenty products but it's a lot of shimmer but like i said it's not overbearing so you don't look like you just rubbed your lips in car oil it actually just gives you a little shine and a little gloss and it's not sticky and the packaging is super cute i'm a sucker for some packaging like i'll literally buy something if i like the color of the packaging my next one is this little charm necklace has a key on it and the key has the number 21 on it it has a r it has a t and it has an e so my best friends got me this for my 21st birthday hence why there's a 21 on the key my best friends are called rebecca and tamara so rt and e for ella these are my best friends since i was three years old i literally wear this every day obviously i have on my 10 summers chain right now but that's because i had to show you guys this but on every day unless i'm like going out and i want to dress up i will have this one this is my everyday chain i think it gives me a piece of home since i don't live in england anymore okay so this

GQ Videoseries,you've had on your show hi gq this is sam smith here and these are my 10 essentials i feel like i talk about robin more than my own music i just love this album i got it on vinyl recently and i'm obsessed with it it's so cool she's so cool she's the reason why i'm queer for me as as a record from start to finish this was so incredible and it's just the soundtrack to my summers really it's a perfect summer album it's easy to listen to and it is genuinely like honey the whole record sounds like honey to me i've got a record player in my house now and i really enjoy it i'm impatient sometimes with the whole changing over and stuff but it's i find vinyls to be the best
GQ Videoseries,to play when you have people around there's something so wholesome about feeling something you know i really i think we're losing that a little bit with music when you hold something like this you realize it's a piece of art just like any art it's always a lovely moment when i hold a final in my hands my own record this is a magical skin serum this is called c e ferrulic skin cuticle stuff this brand skincare of course is my favorite skin care brand i use it instead of moisturizer and it's just so good for your skin this this stuff though you only use twice a week because it stains your hands a bit orange it's incredible it's just so good for your skin and i've noticed such a difference with my skin i used to just always put loads of moisturizer on my face and i found this to be so much nicer and there's another there's a hydrating uh one as well it sounds like they've paid me but i have to i have to buy this they don't give it to me for free oh it doesn't smell good it just smells like chemicals this is leo everyone say hello to leo sometimes i just like to hold him i have this in my house as you walk in my house and everyone is really offended by it and absolutely hates it and is scared by it and thinks it's the grossest
GQ Videoseries,they've ever seen but i think it's beautiful i was with my dad on the trip to bruges there's a random art shop and i just saw this in the window and it was really expensive i don't know why i got it it made so much sense in the moment i was like i have to have that and now i just i really don't understand it's a camel with the baby's head and it's called leo but i've decided that it's my i think it's beautiful and i freak everyone out when they come around my house and see it creepy you're just like what the hell this is a coffee i love coffee so much it's an addiction but it's a good addiction it's one of i i've actually read many health benefits of coffee i love getting a coffee and going for a walk waking up in the morning and having a coffee i used to love a coffee and a cigarette but i've had to stop smoking because i sing it's bad for you it kills you so i'm not really a coffee um snob i actually love starbucks coffee starbucks coffee to me tastes a bit like um ash not ash it's like bit burn but i kind of like that taste i always have my coffee just black i don't really like milk i find milk a bit weird a lot of the time i love cheese but i don't like milk normally i'll have a coffee and it will last me two hours it will go completely cold but i will still be sipping on it for a couple of hours oh it smells so lovely this is takeshi everyone uh he is a fat cat from japan he's so cuddly honestly i can't express like i don't even like cats really i'm more of a dog person but look he sits here like this and he just sits perfectly he's so sweet i was going through a breakup on tour and i was in tokyo and we were in this market and um i saw him in the shop window and i was feeling so sad that i just needed to hug something constantly he became this funny
GQ Videoseries,in the tour because i would treat him like an actual real life child the people in the hotel actually when i walk came back into the hotel he'd be waiting by the door for me because my security would talk to the hotel and always do it as a joke i just love him a lot honestly he hugs so well he's just so fat i'll always have him on tour with me he um he has to be everywhere i am i think he might be the reason why i'm single too my biggest joy in life is a tuna melt from a place called karma bread which is down the road for me it's disgustingly fattening look at this it's a heart attack and a sandwich but it gives me so much joy and whenever i'm on tour and i'm sad i think about this sandwich and it gets me through great for a hangover great for a broken heart it looks a bit gross but i just love beige food basically i like fish and chips i love crisps fried chicken just anything fried really it's embarrassingly british i think okay this is the bougie
GQ Videoseries,oh i spend way too much money on these this is called sierra troudan and it's a candle i've been told it's the oldest candle brand in the world i love the smell of it if they all smell like old churches i don't know why that's why i like that smell it's a romantic smell it's heavy i love it and i mainly love it because i love the green the dark green glass and the gold it reminds my mum loves dark green and it makes the house look prettier and more whenever i have visitors in my house i'll definitely burn candles and also bath time for me is a cat i put loads of candles on and have baths a lot to de-stress this is my first shoe my first ever hill i got this from a drag store called priscilla in sydney when i was 22 and it's the first time i ever wore hills was in this i stuck this little flower in it looks pretty gross above my bed there's a little shelf and i just have it above my bed and it always makes happy it's very dusty and all the sequins are starting to fall out here i think what drew me to uh this shoe is the ruby slippers from wizard of oz i love judy garden so much it's my dorothy hill this is a little picture frame my sister lily who's on this one here got me this for valentine's day two years ago i was on tour and i was a bit low because i was missing all my family and this has got a picture of me my dad me and my mom me my sister and then me and my other sister and i just keep that by my bed and it comes around with me when i travel me and my family are very very close me and my sisters boy best mates and we've lived with each other on and off for the last eight years and yeah then my rocks sometimes we're too close sometimes it's exhausting being in the family to be honest most of the time it's it's wonderful and saving the best for last it might be a bit dirty because i haven't watched it celine dion falling into utor it's called falling into you around the world that's the world that's celine i just love this so much i asked my stylist to get this for me not very romantic story but i uh i saw it and i was like i have to get this t-shirt because i wanted to wear it for a live performance my first memory of music was hearing it's all coming back to me now by celine dion and i just love her so much i went to see her live in hyde park last year and it's a beautiful memory to escape to during these covered times it's just so incredible to see someone just stand and just sing and deliver and story tell and her humor and her character is infectious i look up to her in every way i hope i'm like celine when i'm older and it also reminds me a lot of how to lose a guy in 10 days kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey when they go to the celine dion concert okay that's it gq you have seen all of me i have nothing more to show you i am made up of camel babies and tuna melts
GQ Videoseries,rose and these are my essentials  this is one of my essentials because it's a i don't know what it's called i'm a big fan clearly remarkable and as you can see oh i don't know how much you can see actually but it's pretty dented and pretty bruised and it's traveled with me for a long time but this is what i read my scripts on so i prefer to be paperless the environment so forth but also i can't just use my laptop or just use an ipad because a the color and my eyes get really tight after a while and b there's your emails pop up your text messages pop up all these things and you get distracted and then you're not reading the script but you can write on script so if i receive a script and download it to here i can write my notes on the side of it and then send it back to a director or a producer or you know whatever  what is this you might ask it's a yoga mat yes for many years my nier's resolution was to do yoga and for many years i did not do yoga one of the good things that have come out of this tragic and sad time is that i finally did yoga and and a lot of other things to do with self-care and and exercise but i brought this mad in because hey i'm quite proud that i do yoga and pilates now and stretching and also it's uh jaron street so it's an australian brand that sent me this in australia there's a lot of people that steal aboriginal designs their art their culture and they use a lot of their artwork without permission so this is aboriginal art done by aboriginal people and they support other indigenous brands as well so for me i was like this is really cool it's super comfortable it looks awesome no it's like samurai sword in here what's happening and it's also essential because when i stop doing yoga or pilates my dogs decide that this is what they're gonna nap on for the whole day look at this i could just get on the table right now and do pilates which i would have never done for the last 30 years of my life so yeah it's my essential because it was one of those things that during this time the final things to do we're trying to work out how to stay busy mental health physical health good food and yoga and pilates and stretching and things like that is a really good way to meditate actually i meditate on this as well so they're all the good things essentials boxing gloves also that this doubles because it's also tie-dye and one of the things i got really into during foreign team was tie-dying everything so when that's no longer cool i'm in trouble because my i've died everything i started boxing again recently so for the first part of quarantine i gave myself this
GQ Videoseries,where i'm like i've been exercising and training really hard for 15 years i deserve to do nothing and eat whatever i like and i did that i still don't fit into any of my jeans and i'm okay with that but the one
GQ Videoseries,i recited up again recently was boxing and i actually competed i was an amateur boxer for a couple of years and i competed and one i'm undefeated because i was only two fights and my mum made me stop but it is one of those things where i like to do the exercises that are good for the soul and the spirit you know pilates yoga meditation all of those sorts of things but i also need to be like cardio like i need to get energy out and i think it's important to when you get frustrated to have an avenue and boxing is a really good one for that so when i'm kind of feeling a bit foggy and i'm not feeling like i have a purpose or direction or you know that i can't do something boxing is a great way to just go and get all that out and get exercise at the same time three times a week and then i just did a film with morgan freeman and i didn't work out for three weeks and then i went boxing again and i lost all of that in three weeks i'm so mad but yeah i go three times a week and i would go more but i go to this place called glove works and it's no joke they're really tough this is a drink that i love i'm also an investor in it so you know just just keeping it real but i basically harassed these guys because i was spending so much money on this drink getting one every day and trying all the flavors that for a year i was hassling them to be like come on like can i invest in the company can we work together i'm obsessed what rev will do is they keep everything so it can be sustainable and they just go to the sauce so you get the best ingredients this one is cold brew coffee rishi so a lot of these have chinese medicine herbs mushrooms roots ashwagandha chaga they're all really good for you and coffee can make me feel like a bit anxious if i have too much whereas mushroom coffee never does can't live without it love it try it someday i don't know i'm not trying to do an ad i just literally can't live without it this is trough this has changed my life and mind you i've been practicing to be less attached to things really attached to this it's a truffle hot sauce which to me when i heard about it sounded like the worst idea that anyone could come up with who wants a truffle hot sauce like truffle on its own is the flavor right i was wrong boy was i wrong i add this to everything literally everything savory sweet there's another one that's like white truffle this one's black truffle i give it to all my friends and people are like really happy birthday you got me hot sauce just you wait i go through a bottle this size every three weeks maybe every two weeks i can't think i'm so obsessed with hot sauce this is weird and that it's one of my essentials anyway sorry about that we're not really strangers this game is unbelievable it's such a fast track way to get to know someone that you don't know you get to find out really interesting things about the other person in a way that feels so organic whereas if you're just talking to someone at dinner or you're on a date or you're hanging out for the first time with a new friend you can't just ask them these questions like what did you really think about me when you first met me when you play the game it puts it in a context that isn't weird and i've not only like become really close to people because of this game i've also become closer to like my best friends things that i didn't know about them or they didn't know about me i love anything that allows people to feel more comfortable connecting we misunderstand people and games like this not only is it super fun but you do you get a better understanding of people and i love connecting and i have realized even more so during quarantine i do need human connection i do need my friends i do need to check in on my family more and now that i've done that that's one part of quarantine that i won't stop when we go to the new normal whatever's gonna happen there better you get people drunk too because they get more honest but you don't get drunk and then you get to remember it all this oh it's on i'm gonna take it off because it's on a rude finger that's literally about my finger up this is an aura ring and it's a sleep ring a friend of mine convinced me to get this i thought she was nuts i didn't really get the idea it's amazing so it records everything to your sleep pattern when you go to sleep how long you sleep for the quality of your sleep all the things i know i'm talking about sleep a lot but that's a really important part of our health i totally ditched sleep for the last 10 years because you know schedules and traveling sleep has always been a little difficult for me and i know that when i monitor it and i really recognize what's happening okay i went to bed at this time and i only got this much good sleep was it really worth it to watch grey's anatomy for the 20th time to lose this amount of sleep so this
GQ Videoseries,i i just i'm obsessed with it and i think that if anyone has sleep problems or wants to know more about their sleep then this is a great
GQ Videoseries,to get crystals yes i'm one it's so la isn't it but i swear i did this when i was in australia so it's okay crystals and and healing properties and having them around again they're just something that i love in my house saging palo santo i'm very much into holistic medicine and all kinds of alternative therapies and ways to feel good self-care baths if i could bring a bath here i would that's also
GQ Videoseries,but i do have a huge collection of crystals i love them very much and i like to get them from different parts of the world as well when i travel so they not only remind me of places i've been and those experiences but they also look and feel beautiful to have in the house i keep crystals everywhere by the bed by the spare bed in my lounge room and my kitchen because that's where i spend most of my time i have a giant amethyst that i have at the front door there's sort of certain places where they recommend that you put them in there's places where you just feel like i want to put this here and so i'm going to sage is super important to me too it's just one of those things where i've traveled if i've had a bad day if someone's had a bad day and they've come to my house and they're going through a breakup and they've got this energy when they leave i'm like i love you come back soon i'm like get all that energy out of here because it's good to get the energy out of you and it's great to turn to a friend but you don't want to be stuck there kind of still thinking about she should have dumped him earlier and you should i should have told her to dump him earlier so if you sage you end up having less regrets about those kinds of things it also smells amazing this is very exciting guys and you might not have heard of these a mask and i'm sure that sounds very like okay great yeah face mask what you couldn't think of a tenth essential this is so essential right now this is the most essential aside from nurses and carers and delivery people and all the people that are working on the front lines but this is what we can do this particular one the pure mask is my favorite let me let me just read it because i don't actually know exactly it's thin and light could have told you that i am holding it it's a nano fiber filter i'm not exactly sure what that is but it's not like nano fiber it sounds pretty cool but it is it has like three layers so nothing comes in nothing really comes out but it sits a little bit further away from your face like a lot of the other masks like really kind of on there and when you're talking it's like this is happening and you're sweating and this sort of sits a little in front of your face so you're not sweating you can talk and hear because there's nothing worse than when someone's talking and you go so i can't understand you and they're like hold on a second i'm like no not that rather not you then yeah i recommend these these are my favorite thanks for checking out my essentials i hope that some of them were interesting and uh maybe you'll try trough or rebel or enjoy just having this conversation good luck be care be care wow all right this is going really well don't you agree i think we've really connected um next time maybe we'll just play we're not really strangers
GQ Videoseries,oh no i'm gonna feel obligated to play for you guys ooh good acoustics in here what's up gq i'm jacqueline grazer and these are my 10 essentials so this is my chapstick there's a bunch of different flavors of scents of this chapstick this is the minted rose one this is a fairly new one i've never used this one before but it's beautiful like the colors it's just beautiful up to you to tell me if it looks rose on my lips or if my lips look rosy either way i'm flattered the smell is just like nostalgic to me this smell reminds me it's like smells like babies or so like being a baby or like smelling like baby lotion or something baby scented oh my gosh it's just like so soothing it smells like it smells like preschool it smells like preschool these are my headphones ah the age-old problem i feel like the classical conventional earbuds are louder than airpods my mom always gets mad except when i fall sleep in the car like she can hear the music going through because i play it so loudly i use these every single day i use these when i travel whenever i'm just like idle sitting or doing my homework sometimes or trying to not listen to someone or something i put these in my ears and i crank it up if i leave the house without these then i'm gonna be bummed for the rest of the day even though they get tangled in my keys and even though it's hard to skate in them and walk in them because they get caught in things and then they fall out of my ear and i get a little bit aggravated i like these more because they're louder and it's humble it's like i'm not showing you that i look i have gold-plated air pods from straight from the apple store in dubai i have these that are tangled and went through the washing machine these are my four rings i love the kind of rings that aren't like jewelry it's just like it's just metal i like it because it makes my finger it turns my finger green and it's and it's kind of grimy and it looks like it's made out of pewter and it was like found and dug up somewhere this is one actually that my girlfriend gave to me before we were dating and i've just been wearing it since this one i got in mexico from a fan in monterrey and she was so sweet i liked it because it was made it's made from a bearing so that one goes here last but not least my girlfriend gave me this one as well it says j plus c on the inside of it because her name is celia it's just a beautiful ring i think it's really beautiful and so i put it on on this finger and that's just that's just kind of like a dominating feeling makes me feel better about having headphones with wires this is my fisheye lens i skateboard so i take skate videos i like put that there and it's like fisheye this is the future of filmmaking filming someone taking a selfie i love fish eye effect i love that kind of
GQ Videoseries,fisheye in the face this year i started in a film production class but i've been doing this forever i've been making like skits and videos and stuff but i don't use the fish eye as much as i'd like to but i always have it on me just in case just to be safe if i want to film someone up close like oh dude you got a great nose for this fish eye i don't say that to them but in my head that's what i'm thinking these are my keys so kids are now putting their keys on their belt i'm the one who started that trend in fifth grade i started doing this anyway just had to clear that up this i got in um in florence italy when i was filming the show we are who we are at the museum where the statue of david is it says firenze italia then another really like this is the essential part i could go without the keys i just need this
GQ Videoseries,and people are like oh no do you have a screwdriver on you and i'm like or do you have a bottle opener do you have a serrated edge and i'll be like oh but then this carabiner this is a special carabiner because it does this it's not that special but it does this so you can like make sure it doesn't open by itself this is a jaw harp it's an instrument that came from asia i don't actually i'm not too clear in the history but when i play it you'll know like it's like it sounds like an american staple kind of
GQ Videoseries,it's obscure and i'm and i guess i'm obscure oh my god i'm so obscure and it comes in this little case and you can put it around your neck if you want but i don't do that that's kind of too flashy for me i'm not a big gloat about the jaw harp i keep it on the down low air maze cologne intense vetted this is actually the first time i've gotten this uh model species version i usually get the ones that are like colored my favorite one is the red one but recently i got into this one and it's really nice it has notes of patchouli and it's got kind of like a rugged
GQ Videoseries,it also induces an amplification of self-esteem it feels good to smell good when i was a little precocious little nine-year-old i was obsessed with colognes it made me feel adult it was like my my form of like little young baby rebellion not smelling like chocolate pudding but smelling like air maze actually had more cologne then than i do now i have one bottle of cologne now i should have two one for date night and one for business mmm notes of extreme blast and body odor it is degree i've tried like the ones that have honey and oatmeal and duh it feels like actually it makes me it makes my armpit smell worse oh god i sound really gross but whatever it smells like my one of my really good friends his armpits i emulated him and and getting this flavor flavor my friend wyatt uh uses this one when we were filming it he was growing hair on his legs and on his arms and and his chest and stuff and i had zero hair anywhere not even on my head i had no hair i was like oh when i when i get hair on my armpits i'm going to use exactly what he uses and i and i am five years later i've been through a lot of speakers in my day but nothing beats any speaker like bugani these things vibrate unbelievably and and it's insane i don't really play that kind of music though but it's loud it's not waterproof i'm not asking for to be waterproof frankly honestly i just want something that's loud but also small enough so i can carry it like this this
GQ Videoseries,has seen a lot of places uh it's been to the beach it's been up in the mountains it's like falling down mountains it's been left at gas stations before i use it in my house and in the morning sometimes on a saturday morning my mom gets mad at me for this but i like open my window all the way and i make it facing outwards and i'll like blast like led zeppelin or like grateful dead or something it's not music that you could ever say you don't want to hear i think maybe that's subjective i don't know how people could be like oh my god turn that rubbish off because like there's there's nothing wrong with it this is my yamaha flute i started playing the flute four years ago i never took any lessons my dad plays the flute and i really loved jethro toll growing up so then i really wanted to learn how to play i don't know how to read sheet music but i would like like go on youtube and like watch like live videos of jethro tall and like look at his fingers and like see what he did with his fingers and it's a hard
GQ Videoseries,to kind of keep up with but once you you figure it out you uh it's like it's easy i suck right now because i'm tired but keep in mind i never took a lesson so yes i skateboard and when i went to madrid for a convention i got the coolest board ever this is not it when i went to madrid for the first time i did a convention and i went to this skate shop called welcome skate shop and there's a guy there jura damager such a cool guy he made me a board and i got the cool deck and like the grip was really cool because it was half green half black trucks were like these thunder it was like this thunder collab that i couldn't even post about because i wasn't released yet it was the coolest board i'd ever received in my life and also i learned all the the greatest tricks i've ever learned i learned on that board and of course it had to get stolen stupidly enough i left it at school on friday and it was there the whole weekend and then i came back and it wasn't there but also it's annoying because that same
GQ Videoseries,did happen to me and i left a board that i kind of didn't care about that was kind of trashed and like it was chipping in it was kind of grody no one stole it this is not the board but it's still a really awesome board nonetheless it rides real well probably because you're the damager made it judah the damager that's his instagram name it's a really good board i got this recently for my 17th birthday it rides real well but in all honesty i don't know if anything will ever beat that board that the first board that i got in madrid alright gq that's it thank you for checking out my essentials love you
GQ Videoseries,sometimes like the oil will make a little you know pattern on the other side art you're getting the oil off your face and you're making a what's that called a what's that rorschach it's like a like a rorschach with the oil on your face that's gross what's up everyone my name is leslie odom jr and these are my essentials this is my trusty bose revolver speaker i travel quite a bit and it is the perfect size for a single room be it a bathroom bedroom a hallway it's just a really powerful little personal speaker the sound is fantastic i was away on vacation recently and i didn't bring uh when they send me mixes to listen to stuff i say they're my producers my collaborators they want me to listen to it on like very specific headphones and i didn't bring them so i listened to the mixes on the bulls revolve and it's it's the strangest
GQ Videoseries,but you get the surround sound you really can hear the detail and you really feel like the sound wraps around you to your lantern lights the way you put your tunes on and they light the way  oil absorbing strips after a long night hanging out after a show or something like that you know like the sweat turns to oil and like i just get like real shiny up around here so these are essential my face gets very oily ever since i was a teenager these haven't been around my whole life i was probably in high school when these really became like so widely available and i've tried lots of different versions of these like clean and clear are kind of one of the most widely available ones so it doesn't matter where i am in the country or in the world i can always find these so like there's a little sticky
GQ Videoseries,on there that helps it just it's gonna be gross when you see how much oil i have in my face this is my trusty hype mic before this moment that we found ourselves in i mean i was almost traveling to these studios and all this you know big equipment very expensive equipment all over the place and now i do it on this even like little casual videos if i'm doing them for social if i'm doing them for like you know wishing somebody happy birthday or something like that this makes everything sound better actually i'm on an animated show called central park and we have been recording from home and so i'm recording an actual cartoon but i get to make it on this little mic right here you take it to wherever you are in the house it has an attachment it'll attach to your computer or your phone you can plug your headphones directly into the mic it's a really impressive little
GQ Videoseries,people have been very impressed with the quality that you can get from the hype mic so certainly now this is an essential i travel with it all right this one this one's gonna get me in some trouble this is a book of photographs by the brilliant unique harmony corrine for gucci but i've made this my journal i hope harmony's not upset i am a guy that that likes to journal i have like i like it so much when i find a cool journal i'll buy it even if i don't need it and just sort of like i have i literally have a chest of journals in my house for like what you know one day when i finish one i'll grab another one but i've never had a journal quite like this the
GQ Videoseries,that's great about it is that you can open it and even if you're like searching for something to write you can get inspiration from another artist i journal through projects because usually if i'm in creative process the thoughts and the inspiration comes quickly and so i need to have a book close by to write let me do this while i was making my record mister finish the task don't you dare give up you don't have the right god needs some warriors out here god needs some folks who are willing and courageous enough to finish what they've started especially after he starts them i think inspiration comes from the divine you know and so when you are inspired to create something you've got to finish it no matter what it takes you have to finish the task so i needed to hear that and so i wrote it down when somebody finds your work when another artist finds your work and like makes it personal to them i would be flattered i hope harmony is too it's my little journal my cardigan because i haven't had the best track record of holding on to my things i don't get really sentimentally attached to a lot of objects so i bought a sweater in my 20s from this shop on beverly i don't even remember the shop but i spent like 300 bucks on this sweater double-breasted hand-knit black sweater it went with everything i loved the sweater and i lost it i have mourned the loss of that sweater for 10 years so i bought this i did the research and i bought myself this ralph lauren cardigan only 10 short years later to replace my double breasted black hand that's what it i wanted something that was gonna be durable something that would last i wanted some style it's not everybody's cup of tea but like something that i put on you know you might get a couple compliments wearing it and i wanted something unique so this one i really loved the tie i really love the waist tie shawl collar come on it's not bad i wait until the first sign of a chill and like oh it feels like cardigan weather i wonder if i oh oh there's my shawl collared ralph lauren aging sweater in the back of the closet maybe it's time to get my sweater and a cup of hot chocolate these are my lgr sunglasses i will admit to you that i spent way too much money in my 20s on sunglasses the first time i ever got my hands on like a chunk of change i went to melrose and i bought myself some sunglasses real sunglasses one day i was telling my friend who's chastising me about how much i'd spent on sunglasses i was like you know but i'm a collector i have this collection of some people are allowed to collect things and i collect sunglasses he was like okay great so where's your collection because i lost every single one of those glasses that i bought until these i've held on to these longer than i have any pair of sunglasses they are my favorite i would be really sad if i lost them it's a company called lgr it's a little italian brand i just love them i wear them when i perform sometimes because i sometimes can feel it more or find it more when my eyes are closed and these somehow make my eyes never closed especially when i'm first starting out a show a concert like if i can wear these it helps me relax a little bit bevel skin care i've never been skin care guy i've never taken terrific care of my skin i'm ashamed to say but i have started now i did a movie with regina king in new orleans called one night in miami four black men are the leads of this movie and so bevel sent over the skin care for all of us while we were shooting the movie i wear a prosthetic nose in the movie a couple of the guys had to shave regularly and bevel started as a shaving company specifically designed for black men and men of color because that's a tricky
GQ Videoseries,for us and then they moved on to skin care and other things and this it's just my favorite skin care line that i've ever used face wash they have an exfoliating toner and a moisturizing face gel i do think it improves the look of my skin after having used it for a while it also feels nice to be giving a little bit of attention to a part of my body that i lean on a lot not that i'm some you know supermodel or anything but you know like we depend on our skin quite a bit right my skin's been with me a long time attention must be paid you know i mean it deserves a little bit of tlc every now and again the company is called saint rita parlour and this scent is called rita's car this is the scent that i share much to her great annoyance i share the scent with my wife she bought it there's a little boutique that we love here called carl's atelier a unisex scent but i happen to think it's more masculine i would tell you about it i would describe it to you but i think that they do a better job they say notes leather vanilla musk tobacco rare coins and fresh cut foliage come on rare coins nicolette keeps it on her and her side of the on her side of the closet and every now and again when i see it i feel i feel good i just [Applause]  you know real quick just love it books books are an

GQ Videoseries,we just say bubble tea on the east coast and here in la we say boba so i love you dan but uh you were wrong it's an avocado guys it's an avocado i have a special relationship to avocados they're my main source of sustenance as i said i can't cook but you don't need to cook when you have an avocado with you every morning i'll cut one of these babies up usually put some everything but the bagel seasoning on it a squeeze of a fresh lemon and you're good to go they have to be perfectly ripe by the way i i hate nothing more than an unripe avocado so when i go to the supermarket what you do is you can actually take this top off like so and if you see inside you can see a bit of the color and you obviously want to see that it's a solid green color um and then you know you you should know that it's it's getting quite ripe where it's there obviously the feel of it will also tell you it's ripe as well you want it a bit firm but a bit soft that sounds contradictory but it's not this one is not the perfect color for ripeness as you can see there's still a bit of green on the outside you want to get a bit of a darker color all around to make sure that it's perfectly ripe and there it is haas avocados or bust shout out to my cali fornians hostas from california right very relevant it's not the mask it's this is a chain or a lanyard i believe it's a lanyard we all have to wear mass these days the society we live in but what's really really frustrating is that when you have to take off the mask to you know take a sip of water or whatever it might be you either have to hang it from your ear which i'm not a fan of also i found out recently it's not the most sanitary or you sort of have to like hold it in your hand or put it in your pocket and i'm not about that life i'm really not about that life so my sweet friend made me this little lanyard chain situation that you could attach to your mask and then boom bada boom right a book one of my favorite books the alchemist i i'm a pretty voracious reader i chose this because it's one of my favorite books i think anyone who's on the creative path or creative journey they will get a lot out of this book i found this book because a friend recommended it to me and i read it for the first time about seven years ago as most people know becoming an actor is is a very arduous journey there's so many ups and downs but this book just really gave me perspective you know one of the main things about this book is the fact that through all the struggles and the tribulations that you grow and that it prepares you for what's to come and that the universe is conspiring to to help you fulfill whatever your dream is when i read those words for the first time it was really powerful it was very moving and they continue to spur me on and to really enjoy that process if you enjoy that process then then when you achieve whatever you want to achieve it becomes all the more worthwhile this is an emotion wheel there's a piece of tape here because it's currently taped to my bedroom and when i say currently i mean not right now because i took it off for the sake of this video this is an essential for me i think when you can identify how you feel you can process how you feel and when you can process how you feel you can ultimately heal i found it through a therapist he recommended that i start to really name specifically what i'm feeling and so often times when we think of emotions we think of oh you're just happy or you're just sad or you're just angry and of course those are the main sort of core ones but as you get further and further outside of the circles they become more specific and i think the more specific that we become the better in tune with how we feel and all the things that i just mentioned i'll do an exercise right now i am feeling in awe of this situation primarily because i used to watch these videos and it's very surreal that i'm in one of them now also feeling a bit vulnerable i'm sharing my emotion wheel my bible faith has been a big part of my identity and my journey and it's something that's really important to my core values and my beliefs i think it's really unfortunate and it's really heartbreaking that this text and the church has been weaponized in many ways to hurt a lot of people particularly those from disenfranchised communities but for me my faith has always been about love and and kindness and forgiveness and compassion my parents gave it to me at my middle school graduation there's a lot of history uh in this it's sort of been with me through the many ups and downs of life unfortunately i i don't read it every day my brother is a pastor and will be upset that i don't but i try to read it every few days at least once a week i always return back to the psalms i find them very comforting i think david writes in the psalms with such honesty and vulnerability especially when he's going through hard times and hardships and that you know through all that he can still trust that that god is working for him and and has the best in mind for him things like that uplift me and keep me on the path my ranch set of sweats this is a sweater that has a heart made of pizza and ranch and this is a sweat pant this is the iconic hidden valley ranch bottle now there's a story behind this i posted a random instagram story about how much i love ranch somehow somehow hidden valley ranch found that story and they said we're so glad you're a fan of ranch we'd love to send you some things and within the week i got this ranch set i had no idea things like this existed this is the most comfortable set of sweats to wear i wear to sleep i wear it to the airport i just wear it all the time essentially is what i'm saying i eat ranch with everything fries buffalo wings of course buffalo wings sandwiches you put me somewhere give me a tub of ranch and i'll be fine i think the ideal ratio for ranch to food is 75 ranch 25 food i love ranch this is my journal this is my current one as you can see i've journaled religiously for the past seven years that sounds really intense but a lot of times it'll just be a sentence or a paragraph obviously i have days where you feel it coming you know you feel the emotions and the writing it just comes and flows journaling allows me to process my thoughts process my feelings and yeah it's it's always so fun to look back and cringe at how embarrassing i used to be years ago when i first started journaling like 10 years ago i it was one of my very first journals and i actually lost it i think i left it in like a taxi or something and this is not an exaggeration i couldn't sleep for a month i had these nightmares of someone just reading my deepest innermost thoughts and it gives me chills it gives me chills to this day not that i've written anything bad about anyone in these okay there's no hate in these just thoughts that i'm processing okay i feel very vulnerable again i told you i'm getting in touch with my emotions right okay that's full that's a full circle moment that we had here all right gq that's it that's a wrap on the essentials thank you for having me i will feel feelings after this
GQ Videoseries,not mine mine's outside but this is in case i ever get a dog  it's like it's like a it's a smaller size hey guys it's david dobrik and these are my essentials this right here is extremely important to me it's a charging case i know this is really really lame but i have a method behind it i have two i like having two chargers because while i'm out and about with one the other one is sitting at home and on the charger and then i can come home and switch them so i'm never ever sitting at the charger i hate having my phone at the charger because obviously i can't use it and it's just a pain to plug in at night because i can't see where the little connector is i've got to stop doing these motions i literally do it in every video this is the honest truth my phone hasn't died no i actually died yesterday but before then it hasn't died in like in like three months i think because i'm like i'm on this charging system and when i travel i have one on my phone and two in my bag so i'm ready if you know if something happens i'm stuck in the middle of the ocean i'll have charge for at least 17 hours this is my next essential this is my suave kid shampoo now this is a very particular one i've just recently switched over to it's a three in one so it's shampoo conditioner and body wash i started using these believe it or not when i was younger and i just haven't been able to give this up for some reason these are also great i'm like super hyped on these these are also great because on the back there's always a fact on the back of them this one doesn't have it because it's a three in one so i think they like they omit the fact because they have so many other things in it already that there's no need for the fun fact but um but sometimes it will teach you about like a walrus or like a sea lion um so i've been learning a lot of facts from this it's like honestly a learning tool you're going to be watching this vlog this guy is a idiot and it washes your entire body like you do three squirts on the head and then you do two a little on the body and then it all kind of rolls down like a car wash like a big steam roll over your body because it's three in one so it's you know it's applying everything at once and then you're clean and it just washes right off your toes and it's done deal it saves time and product space so out kids my
GQ Videoseries,is gum gum is super super important to me i have a drawer just dedicated to gum i can't have conversations with people without chewing gum like i hate being close to people now i'm a little like a little more lenient on not chewing gum because of the face mask so i don't feel like i'm like spewing my breath at people and i just always i don't it's not that i don't brush my teeth i do but i just like after i brush it like you still need something in there that's still working at the same time you're talking spearmint is my favorite polar ice not my favorite it's kind of only here to show you guys the different options peppermint's good but if you're gonna go peppermint might as well go all out and do spearmint and i just like the color of green it catches your eye and it goes whoa what is what is in that guy's mouth i want to talk to him and one
GQ Videoseries,i do hate is cinnamon gum oh my god it is the most disgusting gum i've ever had that's obviously why it's not here and it's not allowed in this house oh did you guys say you want to see my gum trick okay hope you're ready for this one oh i did it oh my god i'm never gonna have my first drive that's my favorite gum trick wow that makes me feel good this is my disposable camera this is really really important to me i just started taking disposable pictures like two years ago um i have an instagram account kind of dedicated to them i really like these because they're so not aggressive like you can go into a premiere you can go into like any event and you can take pictures of anybody and no one expects anything because it's just like i look like a 20 year old kid with like this cheap camera but the pictures turn out amazing this is my sexy friend jeff with his sexy friend stas and kelsey this is me flipping the camera off this is julia and leonardo dicaprio at the once upon a time in hollywood premiere they weren't looking at my camera but i stood right next to the camera guy and i quickly snapped this this is benny drawing on my face um for a juice world music video this is margot robbie i asked her if i could take a picture and she literally goes uh okay cuz she thought this was so pathetic it's my favorite john stamos he's beautiful and then you have kendall and kylie deciding the same party this is kylie eating a slice of pizza cheese get it and then this is um this is paris hilton paris hilton by the way is the sweetest person on planet earth the best part about this is you can like really live in the moment i know it sounds so cliche but it's nice to take a picture and not look at it and not have to take 50 other pictures and i even started an app it's called david's disposable and on the app you take one picture and you don't get to see the pictures until nine am in the next morning this one's important this is my elon musk not a flamethrower it's pretty nice right now it's on low flame this is perfect for like when you're roasting s'mores and this is perfect for when you hate your neighbors so it has like it has a little bit of both this has really gotten me like through a lot i absolutely absolutely love it now the next one this is my new perfume it's called david's perfume i know and the name's not crazy but it did take us a while to come up with it there's two different scents this one's amber and cashmere and this one's grapefruit and sandalwood they're both unexpected but elegant it's like the what we use to describe it and we just designed the boxes and it's really cool because it it like opens up um just like an iphone box which fun fact i read somewhere that apple the way they design their boxes it opens faster and faster the higher you get it like matches with your heart rate of you opening the box for the first time this i don't think we matched with anybody's heart rate but it is a cool box it's coming out this september i think and it's available at david's perfume dot com this isn't the finished one that's why it's like falling apart it's all fake here none of this is real this isn't actually my house it's just a green screen heck yeah these are important this is where someone like watches the video and they just like exploit out of it i love waters more than more than more than any of your friends i think currently i drink about five liters of water a day if you were to do bottles it'd be it'd be like 10 of these a day i'm literally a fish and my temperature preference for water since you guys asked is um definitely room temperature even sometimes warmer than room temperature like if it's sitting in the garage on a hot day that's all me it has my name on it now the other most important part about your life is sleep i think it's so important to have like a comfy pillow because you spend like what forty percent of your life in bed thirty percent of your life in bed so this is my favorite it's a bamboo pillow it's a little pricey it was fifteen thousand dollars um so it's a lot i'm totally kidding everybody's face in here was like okay i think it's like 40 dollars i think it's like 35 it's actually a very like affordable pillow it's the perfect amount of soft and firmness and when you flip it over to the cold side of the pillow like everybody loves it's like really cold it's like the perfect amount monocle it's actually the only
GQ Videoseries,i like cold i'm a side sleeper so this i you know the side of my face is on here and then i put a softer pillow that's like a little bit longer it's almost like a body pillow in between my legs i have to have something in between my legs sounds weird sounds really weird this is really important to me i'm just showing off let's keep them coming these are my favorite awards this is my kids choice award and this is my people's choice award i'm a huge fan of nickelodeon and like i used to watch kid choice awards and josh peck got to present me with my first good short story which is crazy i was also slimed at this award show which was really fun i was told it tastes like green apple um but it doesn't so that was a serious letdown these are really cool because i technically only won one of these but when you're at the show right when you win they hand you an award that's not yours yet because you get your actual award that they engrave your name into like months later like it comes in the mail but they gave me one just to hold on camera and i was like yeah when i was so excited and then i left like right away immediately booked it for the door so now i have two they haven't asked for this one back it makes no sense i just don't think they care actually i don't put that in because now they're gonna be like oh we do care we're gonna send a swat team to my house this one's cool because it's a kaleidoscope and you can look through the back and it's like a proper kaleidoscope and then these are so incredibly heavy look at this look at this like crack my table it's perfect for when somebody robs me and now i have two of these one deserved and one knot i love awards so much and i all i honestly think they're kind of pointless like it's kind of weird that people decide what is great and what's not so i'm just i've just been making my own awards tick tock of the month top content creator this is like not a real

GQ Videoseries,i don't wash them ever you know they're jeans if you want to dress up dress up they're made to be rough roughhoused and and all those things the best compliment you can get in your jeans are oh your legs are good today or oh nice shoes that's a good one oh nice shoes which means everything you got going on has brought their attention to your boot game or to whatever shoes you wear we'll talk about that in a second cause i have a pair there that i wear quite often  these are my tennies these are my tennis shoes no shame these were given to me and i have not taken them off since i grew up in converse reeboks payless and the plethora of the payless genre which i thank you very much for getting me through elementary school and junior high school but then i got these and what i liked about these the most is that they came kind of pre-pre-scuffed they have proper creases um they have the  everybody knows what i mean when i go which means tied or untied you can just and you're good to go don't act like you don't know what i mean if you don't know what i mean you need better shoes  here it is dr dennis gross alpha beta extra strength daily pill now we're just going to demonstrate i don't i don't know any other way to do it so it's quite simple you take them out uh you do it so you just wipe right it's an exfoliant it exfoliates exfoliate what's that mean g what it means is it begins to turn over the dead cells on your skin because the dead skin clogs the pores allows oil to build up you know what's not gangsta pimples you see that you maybe you can't right but that's real the second one is an anti-aging neutralizer i don't know what the that means anti-aging neutralizer but i do know what it does and i highly recommend it you just hit it again a second time you can hit your lips you can go you can get in your beard whatever beard  we're done we've done it i did it thank you very much thanks for watching these are my 10 essentials peace
GQ Videoseries,what's up gq i'm alyssia cara and these are my essentials  so where do i start i don't even know which one to pick this is a diffuser it's a weird contraption you put it at the end of your blow dryer it's for curly hair so if you've ever seen my hair completely frizzy it's either like i didn't have one of these or like i couldn't find it or i didn't have time to diffuse my hair and i just had to blow dry it like some hotels especially in europe like i can't use my hair dryer because of the plug like it'll explode i've had a hair dryer blow up but i've figured out ways to manage without it like air drying it is fine but this just makes it so much better and it adds so much volume to my hair and just makes it look a lot nicer the next
GQ Videoseries,is this perfume by lancome called la vie belle i've been wearing this for a few years now i was at an airport i tried this one and i loved it so much but i didn't have any money on me so i was like ah i'll get it later and then my tech leo who's amazing he had his like card on him so he like went back to the store and bought it for me which is so nice and he came back with it i was like oh thank you so much and ever since i just keep buying them and it's like my favorite i have like five of these just at home i feel like it's like my signature scent everybody knows me by this scent it's so strong my best friend like always likes to joke around with me because like i'll leave a room and like she'll know i was there one time when we were on tour she like had to like come into my hotel room for something and she didn't know the room number and she's like i literally just followed your scent and she found my room so this is like my holy grail i love it i'm gonna spray it now i haven't worn it today oh my god it's the best
GQ Videoseries,in the world it smells like candy and flowers and something about the ph balance but my skin just works oh my god such a mess there's like things piled on top of each other the next
GQ Videoseries,is my usb microphone this also looks like a weird contraption but this is great for traveling i always travel with this i have actually recorded a lot of my stuff in quarantine with this i recorded my song a little more on this it's awesome it's just like the best
GQ Videoseries,because you can just plug it right into your laptop you don't even need an interface i really love recording with this and i find that if you just have the right eq on it and just like edit the vocals great it just sounds like a professional mic you don't even need a pop filter you just kind of use it all the way back here and that's how i record a lot of demos some of those demos make it to my actual recordings it's raining it's raining so hard it's like thunderstorming outside um but i actually don't know where i got this i really don't remember but i've had it for years and it's like my favorite
GQ Videoseries,ever sometimes my brother will steal it he'll like come into my room in the middle of the night and be like can i use your mic i'm like for what he just takes it so maybe he's doing some secret studio sessions in his room i don't know fenty gloss this is my favorite gloss ever ever since i discovered it like three years ago it's all i wear this is the gloss balm one so there's like the clear one which is really good but this one is my favorite it's like the perfect shade of like pink and like shimmer in it and it's not sticky it just makes your lips look so nice and i feel like everybody of any skin tone just wears this and looks amazing so shout out rhianna she has a lot of my money that's for sure i met rihanna once it was like a really quick um interaction but i was in like this little house that she rented to write for her and i had to pass the kitchen and then i just heard her voice and i was like that's her she was just so beautiful and so sweet and kind and like i went in for the handshake and she went in for the hug so it was a little awkward but we made it through this is an old-fashioned espresso maker this is what my family uses i have a regular espresso machine too but this is just the old-fashioned way it makes your coffee just so much better i am italian so that means a lot of coffee a lot of espresso i grew up drinking coffee my whole life since i was like five my go-to breakfast was like cookies and coffee with milk i was having lattes at like freaking five years old this one's a really small one so this is like what i usually use for myself at my own house you open it and you put water in here and then you put this like little filter on the top and then you put the coffee at the top and you tighten it and you just put it over the stove and then you just wait and your coffee will start brewing and you lift and you'll start to see like seeing coffee come out of it it's the best it's the best the best way to make coffee in the world in the summertime i'll like make it cold like a cold brew espresso and i'll have it just plain i'm starting to get into the plain black coffee but typically i like just like an oat milk or some sort of like alternative milk i'm like very addicted to it i wonder why i have anxiety and then i realize i have so much espresso since i was five so that's probably the culprit okay this one's a little bit boring but it really is like an essential for my life i need headphones yes these are the wired ones i do not like air pods i like to have the feeling of a wire i like to know where both my headphones are at the same time i don't want to have to charge them so this is perfect i can't get into a car in the passenger seat or in the back without having headphones in it's just like my favorite
GQ Videoseries,to do in the world just put my headphones in listen to music and just like watch the road for hours and hours it's actually become like so much of a habit that i get a little anxious like if i get into a car without them so if i lose them like people who know me know like if i lose my headphones i'm like where are they like i lost my headphones you guys like how am i gonna do this on a plane i need them i'm sort of obsessive with my headphones but i i need them in my life at all times i always like every time i make like a demo i always listen to it on these because that's how a majority of fans listen to music too so it's nice to get that perspective but whoever i've been listening to janae eco's deluxe version of her album is so good leanne the havos just released a new album which is amazing i've loved her for years so that's what i've been digging into these last few months next
GQ Videoseries,is a film or disposable or like polaroid camera this is a film one that i got from like this weird mall i went to go develop some film pictures and the guy was really really nice and he gave me and my friend a free little film camera it was the sweetest
GQ Videoseries,ever because my other one broke so he was like just take this i'm like that's so nice so i cherish this one it doesn't have any film in it now but i always carry like a disposable camera with me or like a polaroid one it's i think the best way to take pictures i feel like when you're taking photos on a phone everyone's always like let me see or like let's take another one but this is like totally candid you can't see what they look like so it's just one and done and you always capture like the coolest little moments i think honestly i feel like there's no thrill better than like waiting for a film to be developed and then like seeing it for the first time and seeing what photos you took it's the best
GQ Videoseries,because you often like forget especially if you're on tour and then you develop them months later you forget what pictures you took and then you remember and it's the best feeling it's never really me which is i think i want to try to do more is like getting my friends to take pics of me because if you were to see like my photo albums like i'm not in them so it's like i wasn't there in any of those moments because i'm always like taking them my best friend live she's good with that she'll always take pictures of me which is nice because at least there's proof that i was there next this is mario badescu skin care facial spray with aloe herbs and rose water established in 1967 it's like this really hydrating spray that you can use as a setting spray just to hydrate your face throughout the day i have like a thousand bottles of these as you can tell this one is like almost done but i just love to just spray it on my face it smells like roses and sometimes like an old lady like your grandma like think of your grandmother it's probably what this smells like but it's very good i feel like it just hydrates my face and just makes me feel like i'm taking care of it throughout the day don't know exactly what it's supposed to be used for i just think it's hydrating and nice and it sets your makeup actually pretty well i don't have a specific way that i spray it i think i just put too much like that's my way it's just like i just love the look of just being like like i just came out like inside from the rain like like i was just rained on all over my face and i feel like you can never have too much of it you can never be too dewy that's that's my

GQ Videoseries,about these notebooks too is you can make your ideas come to life  what's up gq i'm zach king and these are my essentials legos legos have always been a huge part of my life i have a pretty extensive lego collection both at office and my studio space and there's actually a term i'm technically an athol which is an adult fan of legos for me legos are therapeutic it's like the
GQ Videoseries,i enjoy coming home from a busy day and i think what i enjoy about it is actually going through the manual and being told what to do i've kind of realized over the years following directions i get to enjoy and do in the lego process the rest of my life we're usually creating the directions as filmmakers one of my favorite series that they have is the architect series and i bought all of them and i buy them as i go but i don't build them until i go visit that city so it's a fun
GQ Videoseries,when you see it in my office that it's built that means i've been to sydney or wherever i love building sets that mean something to me like the movie theater here i got this when i was in high school when i went down to film school it represented like kind of the career path that i was off to i probably will never be making movies for the big screen but you know here i am making movies for little devices for millions of people so it's a different different world  this is
GQ Videoseries,this is the flamethrower by the boring company and a lot of people have commented that it's not technically a flamethrower but i don't care it's still super cool i actually found it more practical than i ever thought one it's super entertaining for my kids it buys me about 30 minutes of parent time which if when you're a parent of two kids under three years old you know that's a lot of time we'll make marshmallows and s'mores i've also used this to help cook and some things you can do with desserts like creme brulee is burning the top it's really handy let's see if it just  burning the mic i don't think that's supposed to be leaking i'll have to report that to elon  this is one of my 3d printers and the reason the 3d printer is really handy for me and my studio team is it allows the brainstorming and the ideas to be really limitless because we know we can 3d print it most likely so if we're talking about a concept where we need a trash can that's an exact specific size that comes with a cute little bag we can print it out and spray paint it silver or whatever needs to be i did a trick once where i i was playing catch with myself and tossing the football and then it turned into a mini football in the foreground and we'll take a regular football eventually we scale it down to the right size and we paint it and it's just a really cute miniature  it also comes in handy currently with corona we've been printing these masks so we don't print this plastic visor but we print the headpiece and the bottom clip here we're sending these pieces out to hospitals so that they can you know protect people if there was 3d printers when i was a kid i would be all about it and geeking out it'd be probably more important than legos to me but i mean you can kind of 3d print legos i've done it this is an
GQ Videoseries,for me this is a boosted board i'm either biking or boosted boarding around my neighborhood to go pick up groceries or just to entertain myself or my kids i'll put one kid in the front one kid in the back and we'll just sit on the ground what's great is over the years i've i've had every version of the boosted board so i have three of them and so i can go out with two other friends and just do a little brainstorm session while we're boosted boarding these things go a deadly speed uh i've taken some pretty bad falls on it myself i've never clocked it but i do ride it 12 miles to my work and i book it so take the bike path  these are some of my rc airplanes when i get into a hobby i'm kind of like my dad where i go really deep into the hobby and so i started with these maybe 10 or 12 years ago and then quickly was escalating up to these guys and then bigger wingspans and eventually i got my own pilot's license i fly both rc and real single-engine aircraft you know there's so much more stakes when you're flying a single engine aircraft with a friend or a family member so you can't mess around and do loops and like i'm gonna go dive down this tree and see if i can make it like you only get one chance at that so again i think that's why i enjoy the rc aircraft i actually fly with my kids i have two remotes so i give them each remote and then i have the master remote and so they think we're working together but it's really dad flying someday they're gonna watch us and find out their dad was flying the whole time one of the most important items that i have is my epipen the reason this
GQ Videoseries,is important is because i'm super allergic to bees and i'm a beekeeper so let me get my suit so this is what i wear when i'm beekeeping it's a pretty thick material and what it allows you to do is be out by the bees you have a little smoker and the bees will come on you and and some of them will try to sting you but they usually can't get through this thank goodness because i was told after my first sting that landed me in the er that i was highly allergic and all i needed was to get stung like in the neck area which would uh potentially cause me to stop breathing but over the years i've learned how to actually beekeep and it's fun you get some beautiful works of nature it's really honey is kind of art so i absolutely love beekeeping i do with one of my best friends i think i'll be keeping the rest of my life even though i i don't know if my wife is a major fan of it because of the allergy to bees these are my essential three books currently that i've been reading a lot of this book big magic is by elizabeth gilbert incredible read if you want to figure out how to go about a creative lifestyle a lot of little good nuggets of gold and then another book with a lot of wisdom for artists is the artist way by julia cameron highly recommend a lot of cool practical tactile habits to try out and see if it works for you the other
GQ Videoseries,people ask me where i get my ideas and i actually have a very similar mind to gary larson i think his work is genius and brilliant i'll pull out some of his comics and read just a couple pages of one of the far side collections not only makes me laugh but like i'll get video ideas my
GQ Videoseries,with reading is i usually get a book and i'll read it through or skim it and take little sections and then kind of digest it by a chapter so for example in the artist way she talks about different things you can try out for a year and different habits you can put into your lifestyle i will try them um for usually a month at a time so i'll try it out for a month and if it seems like it's working i'll commit to another longer period of time like three months or six months that's what i love about reading you can skim grab a little nugget try it out in your life and see if it works and then if not move on and continue sorting through all the other great literature out there  this is my canon 5d i absolutely love this series this is the mark iv but this is one of the cameras that changed the game for me when it came to filmmaking i got the mark ii when i was uh in high school and i absolutely like it changed the way the depth of field looked in my work it felt cinematic all of a sudden and i think canon makes some beautiful glass as well i spend a lot of my time looking through viewfinders i realize probably many days of my year is actually just looking through a viewfinder but i think it's special because it's your way of seeing the world and how you want it there's a million ways you can film this room even but i get to put my version out there in the world this is also my home video camera so i'll shoot my family videos with the 5d and i know it looks annoying in public now it's funny i like look like a youtuber which is a dead giveaway but i'm not vlogging i'm just making my home videos my kids are funny when they see me with the camera they always say cheese so they think i'm taking photos but i'm like guys i'm i got all these videos of you saying that now  so this is an amazing set of tools this bug hunting kit especially if you have kids like i do you've got your little your grabber and we go bug hunting all weekend saturday sunday and sometimes after i come home from work this is a super fun activity especially here in california there's a lot of fun insects and bugs and toads that you can catch but this is a super special bug container because it allows you to catch some really neat creatures that you may not see with the visible eye like this tarantula here do we know if this one's poisonous how do you know if they're how do you know if they're poisonous this is uh kind of terrifying yeah we're gonna cut to the next
GQ Videoseries,i carry around with me all day every day one of these a moleskin notebook i go through about one every three weeks and i write down everything from what i'm gonna do that day i'm gonna write down ideas that come to me it's really helpful for me to get the ideas on paper and i know there's a lot of different theories on this from different creatives they'll say like oh well good ideas you should always remember them and don't write them down but i found that's with me never i just can't remember or recall the cool
GQ Videoseries,i don't name stuff i have many facets of weird and i admit that but naming like inanimate objects is not one of it but i don't mind people who do i don't mind at all what's up gq i'm jacob montgomery and these are my 10 essentials  so for me my
GQ Videoseries,is my lighting i'm super weird about my space i'm really ocd about the house and i love my space i think space is all about light you can buy these smart lighting packages called hue h-u-e light bulbs basically you connect this box to your wi-fi router and that box creates a little wi-fi network for all of the light bulbs in your house when we moved into our new place i started building a lighting scape that was like predominantly these light sort of purpley hues and everything's on the floor and shines up i hate down lights i'm really weird about down lights and i never use them so in our living room we've got a couple and in our bedroom we also have a couple and then i have one in my office behind this marble slab that just sort of kind of illuminates the edging i'm super like sensitive about it when i sort of go to bed i slowly bring the whole light in the house down over half an hour when i'm getting ready for bed i'm really interested in life i'm really interested in how it can completely change a mood and a space but it's really important for me to build a lighting scape in my space that's a big
GQ Videoseries,when i travel which is probably my segue into the second essential i don't have smart lighting so i have to use candles again it's that whole down light
GQ Videoseries,i don't like to have down lights so we buy candles when we're away whether they're just your normal white candles or they're you know something like this more of a designer candle with like a really nice scent in it this is balinese ylang ylang this is a popular brand in australia super nice smells fantastic but yeah so candles when we're away i sort of are a heavy supplement but when we're here as you'll see we've got like candelabras all through the house and i go through a ton of tea lights and a ton of small candles and we just it's kind of it when i'm having a shower at night and i'm getting ready for bed we have this little marble slab that sits in our bathroom and i just like one candle in there it's all about lighting when i grew up my mum used to move the house around like every two weeks she'd move all the furniture around sometimes buy new things change things up and every night it was my job to set the table the dining table was the center of our house it was where we all came at the end of a long day and we all spoke about our day and shared experiences so like from a very young age it was instilled in me that that i didn't have to by any means but i somehow had like this profound engagement and interest in in light and design and home the idea of home became so important to me it's just mainly around dinner time and after dinner if you're watching tv that's like the most important time for me to set the mood with candles and i literally cannot focus on a movie like i'm so particular about my peripherals like when i go to the cinema i have to sit for a second or third row and have nothing in my peripherals because i feel like a movie should be or television should be a completely immersive experience and then so when i'm at home i feel obviously very ocd about my environment right so if i'm sitting and watching a movie last night we watched jackie brown for the first time and just everything kind of in my periphery has to match the film and if that candle's out of place i'm gonna pause the film and i'm gonna get up and shift it you know until it's in the right place so it's also heavily tied to filming television and and dinner those two sort of entertaining experiences the third
GQ Videoseries,my car i love cars and i always do a ton of research before i buy a car and so i i went and bought a mercedes e220d it's one of those beautiful ones that you sometimes see on tv shows with the screen right across the dash and all of the lighting built in and sound is so important to me as well fantastic audio system and the preset of the lighting all the way through the car is the exact same purple hue as my whole house like from the outside it's kind of just a white mercedes sedan but on the inside it's all immersive as i say between this screen which really attracted me the lighting component and then the sound component and you know when i was lucky enough to be able to afford it you know it was the first
GQ Videoseries,i went out and did i don't name stuff i'm not that that's not i have many facets of weird and i admit that but naming like inanimate objects it's not one of it but i don't mind people who do i don't mind at all but i just got roof racks for it which has changed the game because i wanted to be able to put my surfboard which is probably another good segue so this surfboard you can see it it's super cool this is not the surfboard that i ride i have a different one down in our shed next to our car but basically this board was given to me by an australian he had a friend who is a photographer who takes these shots of you know the ocean good surroundings and this is some beautiful uh sort of foam off the ocean heading towards the shore and then this is like that beautiful dark color the ocean can get so i love it so it actually exists as an art piece in our house i have not been surfing for long at all i've only been surfing for about a year and a quarter my partner grew up surfing she's a phenomenal surfer and i have lots of mates that surf i have a big connection to the ocean i grew up free diving was part of my high school curriculum you could opt to do it as a program so i kind of fell in love with the ocean when i was really little and then sort of through my adolescence i had the opportunity on multiple occasions to sort of become a freediver that was my
GQ Videoseries,so surfing is just another way to have an excuse to go every day basically the surfboard that i actually use is an epoxy board it's quite wide and it's about 36 liters which is quite buoyant because i'm a chunky chunky guy so i like to have a more buoyant board i quit coffee like two and a half years ago because i was getting the shakes and i was just drinking way too much so i took up drinking tea every morning instead just regular old english breakfast or black tea every morning i get up and i have a cup of tea out of this teapot at the moment when we're home which is like a nice little glass tea pot from t2 it was a gift um from my dad and his partner every night i go to bed i brew this tea and i put it in the fridge and i get it really nice and cold and then in the morning i get up and i pour it in this cup with a dash of milk and it's kind of my
GQ Videoseries,i have like an iced unsweetened tea i guess every morning so i can't drink anything warm i hate hot drinks they just give me like i don't know the heebie-jeebies like i don't i'm not really into it so when i was little my parents and i went to japan and we went to this amazing pottery warehouse in tokyo full of these beautiful handmade japanese plates bowls and cutlery and all kinds of just amazing things and we bought a bunch of it back these beautiful gray handmade bowls they've got like this amazing sort of rough texture on the outside and then on the inside they're usually heavily glossed and they have amazing patterns and prints and all kinds of stuff that's all hand painted underneath when i eventually kind of moved permanently out of home it was really important to me to have plates bowls and stuff like that so we managed to get a whole bunch of japanese bowls and basically what i mean by that is something like this which you can see it says made in japan and basically they just have amazing texture they're really nice to touch everything looks amazing so when we serve food it looks pretty incredible something like this as i say which has sort of a rougher exterior and then it's super polished inside and you can see all this cracked um turquoise glass right in the middle there which is just amazing i don't know i've just it's always been a big
GQ Videoseries,and we have obviously matching sets of bowls and plates and little bowls and side plates and stuff that are all this kind of um milky color like this piece of marble here like all the wood in our house matches our bowls it's all this beige light colored wood a lot of time and attention to detail and like it pays off because you just feel super comfortable in your own environment my biggest source of productivity especially as a freelancer is my laptop because i keep all of my research information writings sketchings everything on there so my desktop is kind of a litter of just uh tons of different ideas or projects that i've had or things that i've been working on obviously a big part of that is is my poetry or writings stuff that i've sort of done on the side my poetry started out as a bit of a cathartic experience i would always write when i was really anxious and basically just wrote and wrote and wrote and i've just got piles of notes and i've just finished my first book which is basically a book of poems so ground up i've worked off my laptop on that book so this is my laptop this is a regular old mac unfortunately uh again in keeping with the aesthetic i like that sort of super sleek space gray no stickers or anything i'm a bit of a cheap skate as they say so i actually don't have any like paid uh software on my laptop so i just use pages and then i also pull up in tandem with little notes box so i'm working kind of in one level of consciousness here which is more like a stream of consciousness and then i pull lines that i like out as i'm going and copy and paste them across but i'll always have like a spotify bar running in the bottom right hand corner to kind of like tandem whatever my mood is to help get those notes onto the page i've only done a couple of projects in my career but whenever i finish a project i have it a bound i have this company in sydney that helps me do it basically i just put them all together like this this was the first film i ever did power rangers and i just pulled a script and i put it inside the book no matter what the film becomes and what the edit looks like this is usually the wrap script and then i just put in there chapter one chapter two is the stranger things which was the second project that i worked on so basically i took i think episode 201 chapter one mad max chapter three which is stranger things season three and the broken art gallery which is chapter four and then i have my own script which is the first script that i wrote was my short film in vitro which is called chapter one from a different category i guess being my own and i had that found in sort of black faux leather but i had had this idea after power rangers and i think during stranger things that i just wanted this memory of of something so these have been great and it's not something i look at all the time but it's definitely nice to have them here i also keep memorabilia from sex which you could say is probably stolen definitely so from broken hearts i took nick's bracelet and then i have a box of stuff which is full of different things so i have the denim jacket that i wore as billy and i have a box of marlboro red cigarettes because i wanted to smoke them instead of herbal cigarettes as billy because the smoke is thicker and it feels like an honest portrayal and then when i did power rangers there was this massive glass wall made of stuff called obsidian rock which was like when we discovered the key to unlock the whole narrative of the film there were these coins inside the wall and on the night they had these massive cannons blocked by the glass and grabbed a piece and i still have it so just it's a little

GQ Videoseries,my next essential is my new favorite game it's called the end this game is so right it's a bunch of cards that have all these questions on them that help you communicate like openly and freely and deeply with either people you're dating your family your co-workers there's like a wee bit in relationship for hella long obviously and now we're playing this version so in the dating one it says stuff like woman's the last time you held someone what do you think is my biggest conflict right now will you look at me what do you see and like both you guys have to answer the question but it's really cool cuz I feel like it's a prompter for conversations that some people are maybe nervous to have and I think that the family one is really helpful as well especially when you live in a house with your siblings it was actually my assistants idea she found it sending to me he was like I think you would love this cuz I just I like to talk with people I mean everybody should it's kind of how we're getting through all this together so I went kind of crazy and Mike bought almost every version of the game and ever since I picked it up I can't put it down my necks ascension is so important as quarantine is black seed oil okay it's disgusting a matter-of-fact smelling it because the top is off is actually making me wanna die this is what you take like a tablespoon of every single day and it's super good for your immune system and I really have to hold the top of it because it's takes oh it's all my fingers it like burns a little bit but it's so good for you and I highly suggest everyone take some black seed oil every day it's kind of one of those things that you always learn growing up if your family was into naturopathic response to body stuff like instead of going and grabbing a Tylenol your mom would say you know do this or do this or take some of this just like fish oil oregano oil low oil they all disgusting but they're super helpful the more disgusting probably the better for you my next essential is my diaper bag yeah buddy this diaper bag is the Holy Grail I think the worst
GQ Videoseries,you could do is realizing you left and took the baby somewhere and left the diaper bag or you left and have the diaper bag but the diaper bag is in packed correctly then it feels like the whole road is crumbling and what are you gonna do so inside my diaper bag I have empty bottles I have measured out formula I have food I have change of clothes I have diapers of course wipes basically everything my child could possibly want and need while we're outside in the world thinking looks really cool it's a cool brand and has a lot of pockets my next essential everybody who knows me knows I go through about 50 million of these a year it's a bow feed first of all I'm a mom so my phone can never die like ever it's just not allowed to die what if I need to call someone what if I need help what if I'm gone and she's with her babysitter or she's with her dad or she's with my sister like they need to be able to get in contact with me at all times my phone not allowed to die as a mom on top of that I'm a working mom my phone can't die when I'm in the middle of the booth reading my lyrics off my phone screen my phone can't die when I'm like reading emails and responding to emails you know it just can't die so these are super helpful we just keep them charged up and usually someone holds it for me because I will probably set it down and if you like flip my house upside down and shook it and all the contents fell out they would probably be like and I'm ashamed to say it but maybe possibly 30 movies in the cut somewhere they're not all this big though this one's pretty intense you do gotta remember to charge in low fees but you know who does that my assistant charted the movies it's if I don't have an assistant my phone would always be dead my assistant is the best she might be my last essential but that truly I would not be functioning as a normal human being feted Hatter and that's sad to say that's sad but I also do a lot all right Thank You GQ thank you for pulling up to my crib and checking out our tuna my favorite most essential essentials and see you on the flipside

GQ Videoseries,that you picture when you close your eyes and picture it Submariner and I love wearing on the show because it doesn't grab too much attention it's just great workhorse watch I can't defend fine timepieces because I know that like there's no real reason to spend this much money on watches but the craftsmanship and the legend of Rolex its addicting I'm completely addicted I'll probably only ever stick to rollies because they entranced me except is my Cologne I believe in smelling good I don't think it costs Lots smell good you can smell good using a very limited budget but I wanted to try to get like a really curated scent so I got this when I was in Paris I went to the Paris for the first time last year and I went to cool parfumerie and I had every intention of having like one of those custom cents made but I smelled this and I was like this is all that is man I threw it out it's called crazy hours by Franck Franck Muller of June of it it's it smells good I like it you would like it too if you could smell it here sorry here we have some Kentucky Bourbon 1796 in it it's very good this is sweets and mellow and complex so it's lovely to sip on its own but you wouldn't be so shy as to not make a cocktail from it you could make a lovely old fashioned with this and I think that's the sweet spot for for bourbon obviously I have an appreciation for really high-end bourbon but this guy's you know it's 50 bucks in New York which means that it's probably 35 everywhere else in the world and then over here I have some lovely songs we French crystal this was given to me by a dear friend for my birthday last year and I love like retro art deco crystal like this you feel like you're you know and when you're drinking from something like this I'm gonna outfit your bar get some cool really thin we're really ornate you're gonna feel like a goddamn king when you drink that's money in the bank okay and also you know glassware like this your kids are gonna inherit this it's been a long day already basil Hayden's make mine up basil Aidan's next up I wear I don't have much of a prescription that's my dirty little secret by like 20 40 and this I 20 30 on this side it's pretty much just like for watching movies and driving at night but I feel much more comfortable glasses especially on camera just makes me feel like I'm in my little glasses house these are Oliver Peoples and these are my bald sunglasses for when I'm not rocking a hat and then these are my hat sunglasses these are Tom Ford and these look better when as you can tell because they probably look a little weird right now but these look better what I'm wearing hat do you agree I'm asking then tech-easy brush flossers these are the pinnacle of flossing technology I am an advocate for daily if not twice daily flossing I floss at least twice a day and as such I have never had a cavity I have never had braces that's not the reason this is not the reason why that happened that is pure luck not even genetics my brother had like headgear until he was like 17 I've never had a cavity I use you know not only the string floss and brush the pics but also these what I really want to get in hardcore about it these guys do a job there is a wire literally a strand of twisted wire in there with a brush coming out of it that's what you're shoving between your teeth this blows out plaque like a mother that I probably use these once or twice a week you will bleed you'll cry you will scream you'll thank me later that's my essentials guys thank you so much for watching thanks for hanging out I hope that you try some of those things for yourself and I'll see you next time on bad wishes 10 non-essentials
GQ Videoseries,all right let's go what's up everybody its Bazzi Here I am currently quarantined at my apartment in Los Angeles California hopefully you guys are all doing the same somewhere safe but nonetheless I am here today to do a special edition of ten things I can't live without first up is as it created being cramped up all day and not being able to go outside this offers released for me to creatively express myself offices I'm able to create music and  Gibson hummingbird this guitar is really special to me she's amazing I've written a lot of beautiful music on it I've taken it to Asia Europe and Hawaii and I use it on a lot of my last album this is like my tour bus guitar nice just being able to have instruments around all the time I think you know makes me feel a little less crazy in here that I could jump on the piano or jump over the top and just get something out if I need to  thank you I grew up on this this is pretty much my job in a box what's it so right off the bat these are just about everything you're going to need to enjoy yourself for the next few months of course we got classic super smash bros mario 25 mario party 5 is an unbelievably entertaining game it's probably occupied next on my list be classic classic classic like this if you look at all my central so far you probably think I'm I'm a five-year-old boy which is pretty accurate to the spirit that lives inside of you but when I was a kid I actually always tried to build Legos and intersected crazy zany it gets enough like five minutes and stacking them up in a stupid random manner as an adult saying that I'm doobies it's so peaceful to just redirection to me you know do something that's almost purposeless has no reward or anything just good for the money I think you just focus on something accomplished itself you got the staff but Legos for the quarantine and one of my best friends and definitely important essentially McRib is growing up the furniture that we had the furniture that we used was never like a choice or selection you know basically got the hand-me-downs of furniture for family and friends and it was just something you had it was never something I was specific and tailored to your okay so this was the first piece of furniture I've bought every time I sit on an X on the list of essentials art supplies as simple as that I think this is important I think if you plan to be an artist or whatever it is if you're not I think this is healthy for everybody the Blake acrylic colors design books this one's actually really cool art of architecture in their campuses in here I can actually give you an example of what I mean by the saying that you don't have to buy a very impatient guy especially with art I like things to be immediate I like that's why I like music because you can create it so quickly I get stuff with my brain in them I'm good eager to get it out so this is my are you really strange personal stuff like under this I wrote a hole just on brain flow on to this next we have a very important element and I hate to say is one I've been indulging in a lot during party it's the spirit session a lot of mine this is actually my favorite bottle of wine this is an Opus one delicious I like anything like that people pay specific attention to the details which is these wines are so many things is so much specificness to it the creation of itself will be done with these in like the next three days next so my fridge is pretty green you would think I was a super healthy guy who saw this but I look at to vegans my girlfriend and her twin sister so I'm like than 80% vegan I definitely try and like I may not lifestyle for many reasons but get the beyond burgers we've got some classic dessert options this is what I said I was 80% begin this is probably when the other 20% comes in is with these Snickers ice cream bars are unbelievable these are a gift from the heavens these are magical that the across the bowls of course have the accessible scribbles if you know you know this right here is my wife 80 grand piano I love this into place I mean when you walk in it's right there in your face I like the idea of friends being over and any time they jump on the piano I spend a lot of time on it and this right here this is super essential it's very important he's actually probably like the main reason why I moved in this place just feel so open a lot of the views in LA are filled with building a new traffic it's long this one's just so green nice having a place to kind of come out you know things feel so big in your world things okay everybody that's a wrap I want to thank GQ for having me times you really tough right now I hope everybody's safe

GQ Videoseries,oh I'm up to about six cans a day high GQ it's me Trixie Mattel and these are my essentials  this is such a sad
GQ Videoseries,"this is my Nintendo switch and this is really great for touring because everybody on my tour bus has one of these and so we all play games like Smash Brothers we play Mario Kart I love dead by daylight I love to play Friday the 13th I'm like 3/4 through breath of the wild my last tour before growing up I was playing Skyrim I don't think that game even has an end I quit after a while I was like we get it there's dragons and there's no modern medicine and so I kind of moved on but I love mice which got to be glued hairspray I've been using this hairspray since I started drying in 2008 it's lit every drag queen uses these if you have like real hair this is quite a commitment cuz this is the type of hairspray that like once you view this on your real hair you're gonna either need to shower or like comb it out to the point where you're gonna see white flakes coming out of here cuz this is like spring glue into your hair I mean if you look at this nozzle this is the same nozzle you use to try to contain like a swarm of bees when you're taking down a nest so if that lets you know what this does to your hair but it's really great when you're wearing as much synthetic hair piled on top of your head as I do you really need something that you can count on me a lot of people think when they really need something to stay they like soak one area but all hair sprays are made to be used 8 to 12 inches from your head so by the time the hairspray leaves the can some of the alcohol goes away so it's actually more effective I buy it on Amazon and I buy like twelve that one ok I once worked with its drag queen I don't want to say who it was because it was Vicki box but I would see that maybe like take a shot of booze and then they would say I'm putting on my personality so like me before the meet-and-greet I will shock them one of these like a frat boy and like punch a hole through the wall and then go hug teenagers the taste in the ritual of it really gets me and like the pre-show mindset only problem is these are carbonated and so like when I'm in a corset backstage about to go on and sing by shotgun one of these you burp a lot the yellow kind is my favorite what would you call it tropical it's lit the normal kind to me tastes like Duracell battery get this this is a really good perfume it's unisex and I really like this cologne because if I'm trying to like get out of drag if I still like walk in somewhere and this is still like on my body I'm not like embarrassed it's not like I have women's perfume on out in public I've been using it for probably ten years people still compliment me on it all the time it's a little strong a cologne you want to wear when you want people to smell you but it's great for drag it's called your kwatak and I think it's supposed to have like a clean water scent when there's pictures of the seaweed on it to me it smells like what you'd hope you'd smell like coming out of a swimming pool clean clean water with like maybe a twist of citrus I just love it beautiful I grew up in the country which means my dental care for the first 25 years of my life was iffy to moderate for somebody like me who lives in fear of getting like advanced gingivitis this is a mouthwash that has no alcohol so if washing your mouth with alcohol kept you from getting cavities mama I'd be fine sometimes if I just like I'm like I can't I can't do the whole bedtime routine I can at least do this swish swish and then on the tour bus I can like wake up and swish this and I know that between my bedroom and the venue if I run into somebody I'm not going to be like embarrassed of the way my head smells so it's a great product I love it I guarantee Amazon it by like three at a time oh hello this is my guitar every tour I get a new guitar this one is a Gibson hummingbird how many birds are great because they have this like beautiful like iconic hummingbird design here and I learned to play guitar for my grandpa on hummingbird I remember being a kid and being really small and thinking this was like huge now as an adult it's so little to me but um I just love this instrument hummingbirds are a few inches shorter than most guitars too so the actual like length from here to here is like a couple inches shorter that's great for travel it's a really popular guitar in like American rock music and sounds like a really like mellow but also like very talented  guess snap horribly like this  this is a Malibu skipper I don't actually travel with a lot of dolls um who does but I get all my I get him his gifts and I collect mostly sixty five to seventy three and this I believe is a 1971 Malibu skipper you can tell because this is right when they changed the plastic to like a super tan nobody really believed in like skin cancer melanoma so all the dolls are sold in like swimwear with super tan legs because they were like what's the worst that could happen plot twist I got this as a fan fan gift and I probably have three of this exact doll already but I'll keep her I'll put her in a different outfit she's um she's probably worth I mean she went to a dealership you could probably get her for like 45 bucks I mean she's not worth the most the most varied all I have I have a black francy which they only made a few of I have a black Francie in the box with the shipping label on it she's probably about a $4,000 doll and you know that seems like a lot because it is so if you guys come see grown-up or you buy barbara now you know what i'm doing with your money I always travel with a bunch of my Trixie cosmetics because even though I tested these way before they came out whenever I'm on tour I still like to keep them on my rotation because I need to be able to take pictures myself in them to send to like our social media team some pens have my office staff send me new formulas to try on the road and it's nice to have some of our current products to try along with it so I can see the difference in shade finish formula etc so we have a few here we have a material girl we have skipper which is really a staple that's really pretty pink and then we have a Malibu which I was writing Malibu with a song around the time this was being worked on so there is some like marriage there and then slime time we actually released this green one for Halloween and it was so popular that we put it in the permanent rotation so it really helps when you own your own company to like try to pay attention to what people respond to because sometimes a product like this which was meant to be limited edition people like nut for and then you're like I should probably keep that around and then this is Stacy's mom which just came out yesterday I have it on now you can tell it's like pink but not like neon it's like a patent leather magenta this is my iPad rich it's coming alive now I'm not proud of it I probably lose two of these a year they just are so little I'm thin and I use them for everything so they get they slip through the cracks I keep all my jokes I've ever written in one like Google Doc so if I ever get hacked my career is over and I also have the entire script for my show growing up on here I also have whatever lyrics to whatever songs I'm working on I also have some some weird fun stuff like I have this game called dream daddy which is a dating simulator where you date people's dads so if that lets you know we're touring takes me mentally sometimes it's good to be able to unplug Oh eBay and I have easy out here because one of my favorite activities on tour is doing deep eBay dives for like weird retro toys that I love to buy so and I have my wall presents plus network on here so I can watch every week's episode of because even though I work for a while presents I still have to buy my own membership I'm not  so how do I stay so thin you ask every day my assistant Brandon wakes me up with a black tea a banana and a green juice during the day you have to eat very strategically because if you're about to go perform and sing and squeeze your body to death to go on stage you really can't like eat much so a product like this that's just like a hundred percent juice I know that I'm gonna get like a pretty modest caloric intake but I'm gonna get a lot of the stuff that's gonna get me through the day like apples and celery and cucumbers and when you're in drag you have lipstick on a juice like a liquid meal is sometimes the difference between eating and not eating at all so yes I live like an astronaut but that's I make a lot of sacrifices to be Trixie this is an Elmer's washable school glue stick in disappearing purple if you don't know drag queens use this to cover their eyebrows because this is like a non-toxic quick drying water-based polymer that coats your individual brow hairs and when you layer it it can actually cover up the texture I'm not a very sweaty person some drag queens use like pros eight or more of like a prosthetic adhesive for this its skin safe and it comes off in the shower they have to make this product so that kids could like eat it and not die I don't really care what happens to the kids but I'm happy that this comes off and last but not least I have entire half days my life where I don't have to be in drag and usually because I'm wearing this much makeup and like um adhesive all over my face and glue and really high impact pigments staining my very fair alabaster skin I like a product like this to wear on my days off so this is milk makeup skin sunshine skin tint SPF 30 so does a sunblock it has moisturizing qualities and it has a very slight tint to it so even though it's my day off I can still make sure I cover things like stains are on my lips from lipstick or areas my forehead where maybe there's irritation from wearing glue on my head every single day a product like this really helps me like make it to a Starbucks without looking like an absolute piece of how it's always worked for me so thank you so much for checking out my essential items here at GQ and if you'd like to see any of these in action please come see my show Trixie Mattel grown up all over the United States in Europe

GQ Videoseries,you got to throw it in like that what's up GQ anthony mackie these are my essentials my most important essential is my trusty iPhone six-plus everything since the six plus has been a disaster so I will always have this phone I don't update I don't do anything to it it always works crack screen I don't care take a little bit of packing tape put over it and start over well the six plus is great because it was the first one that was the big phone so it was obnoxiously bigger than all the other phones so it has a lot of programming and data on it and I had the big one like the 64 mega gigawatts or whatever it was and I put all this music on it so I have stuff that I can't find anywhere else you know like push babies I got gravity on there can't blow first album on there you can't find that stuff on a music streaming websites now it's mine look come on man bust a rhyme extinction-level event you can't I got stuff on here you cannot find and it's quite a nice case it's like snakeskin but it's leather  I am a avid golf player I play golf often about two to three times a week this is my trusty 4 iron it's a great clubs Forge gives you extra little palpable distance I love this club because if it's a par 5 I can make the green in two because this is about my to 25 to 30 Club you have 300 off the tee you go yeah I don't want to lay up and go for it and when I feel real arrogant is when I play golf I go for it all the time no it's a toss-up between Don Cheadle and Sam Jackson now I'm not gonna say what the two of them have in common other than being old black dudes and rich but both of them are very good golfers so that's how you know they rich I'm like somewhat not poor so they're better golfers than me you got to throw it in like that my next essential is the oil Eliminator Kiehl's moisturizer because my t-zone tends to get oily so I have to eliminate the oil with my trusty Kiehl's oil eliminate growing up a little kid in New Orleans you just used like Jergens and you went from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet and that was your moisturizer game but once you get older and like you start going to college and you get a girlfriend and they teach you like shampoo and conditioner it's different than soap like you can't take the Dove and just go dub dub dub dub dub you have to go dubbed of shampoo conditioner facial wash it's four different things just to wash one person so you can't go kids kids kids cut skills you have to go oil eliminator kills then you have to go body keels so they have many different products for many different things to serve you in many different ways that's word up these are my trusty SoulCycle of choice yes it's true I like to listen to rhythmic music and lift weights while I ride bikes for long distances against young women yes we shootin Falcon Winter Soldier now in Atlanta so you have a lot of different cycling places so you have the cycling places in Buckhead where you have like a lot of young women with ponytails that are scream and very angry on their bikes or you can go to the cycling place in Decatur where there are a lot of young angry people who yell and twerk on bikes or you go to Midtown where is just a bunch of nice people that ride bikes no one's yelling no one's throwing stuff everyone's sweating I started smoking cigars I would say it was 2005 I had just finished

GQ Videoseries,I think fish is meat because it's an animal right it's efficient that yeah it's an animal what is an animal a fish is an animal an animal is anything with the sole right I think I'm really on a tangent here I don't even know we're still talking about nasacort right  though GQ actually it's the people who watch GQ hi I'm Dave and I'm a rapper who's goes by little Dicky and these are my essentials can't live without them  first things first warmth I've got this here blanket that is cream-colored I run cold as a human you touch my hands at any moment you know you might be shocked that y'all think I'm sick so I put this blanket on me just to keep my blood warmth up it's not this blanket only like this is not like my childhood blankie I never had a blankie I guess now I do have a blankie but this point here has a good texture to where I bought like four different versions of it different colors scattered around the house two people can fit under this I will wrap it around women when we're watching movies brings bodies closer together in a totally consensual good way nothing weird going on over here I can't even express how important these headphones are to me I actually can't even make music without using these heads it's like a very I they're so worn I've worn them down if you can see the like gristle of the phone and they're worn down in such a way that it actually totally impacts like the Sonics of everything and it's the only way I care to hear my own voice when I record which is totally problematic like if I lost these headphones I really don't know that I'd be able to make music anymore I'm definitely like being I know that is true yeah if I lost the headphones I think I'd have to retire I doubt that like the more a headphone exists the better it gets I think it's pretty counterintuitive I today just in this case I don't know it's hard to explain I don't know like the phrasing or the words I do but there's a sharpness to my voice that if I had the brand-new version of these like it gets much duller and I need to feel not dull because if I don't like the way I sound when I'm rapping who will when I put these on I like really respect myself just like when I'm like you know freestyling and I hear my own voice I think oh my god you really are like the one that's what I look like when I wear them the cord itself disposable got ten of these doesn't matter which quarter in fact this toward sack is too long there's no reason I should might ever have a cord this long it's actually a burden when I freestyle it actually makes no sense ever it's like I don't understand how rappers can go in the booth and like freestyle but jay-z like actually freestyles brilliant pros when I freestyle it's just like gibberish a freestyle about my experience at GQ okay Here I am today at GQ earlier I farted PU I call this the zone it's a white noise machine I call it the show because it's made by Joan every night I sleep with this white noise machine on it just sounds like for the whole eight hours and it's so important I've slept with a with the noise machine my entire life I don't like silence like you hear every creak I think you hear your own thoughts more perhaps maybe I just want to like feel nothing I'm like about to sleep I want to just hear just women sometimes will sleep over and initially be very resistant of the white noise sound they'll say this is unbearable I can't I don't even want to be here anymore and by the morning they'll say I'm getting one for my own house because I had such a great time with you I think part of it is because of your personality another part of it might be because of your zone man initially I purchased this neck pillow for flights but there's something that's so economically unsound about my studio setup at home combined with my frail like just spine and posture choices that makes it an absolute requirement for me to wear this when I rap and record this is like my natural posture look at how it is without I'm doing this birth for our strain right I did my best rapping at like 9:30 a.m. fresh out of the shower contact lenses in I'm seeing clearly there's two screens up and then around like 1:00 p.m. I'll notice a soreness in my neck only from holding my head up I put this on and from about like 1:30 to 6:00 I'm wearing this half the music you'll ever hear from me when I'm recording it it's like me wearing this
GQ Videoseries,you should know that it doesn't take away any of the swag you think it might actually adds value I feel more like a performer when I wear it it's like a futuristic
GQ Videoseries,you know how like Nelly had like the band aid people used to wear like goggles you know chains even this is kind of my
GQ Videoseries,I think it's not really like making waves yet but we're doing this piece and maybe more people will see it nasacort seems pretty self-explanatory but no one can really rap effectively with the stuff nose my nose is just always stuff one time I went to the ENT that your nose and throat doctor and he couldn't believe that I live life this way my nose is stuff to that 95% of the time I can't even smell I have no sense of smell and sometimes it gets stuffed just such a degree that I can't even breathe so I can't rap that way again so this is like this is I probably put too many sports in you know it says I think uses doesn't even say the amount you should or should not use I know you shouldn't be doing like eights quarts a day on each nostril so I spray it and it clears me up at least momentarily and there's no residual like odor I've taken other versions of this and there's this like taste no not with nasal court  where do I begin it is Harry he's an alien one of the best friends I'll ever have he's been around since I was 8 and I'm 31 so you know I'll do the quick math real quick so 23 23 years big nose mouth underneath I draw him a lot like if I was at a restaurant and they were like crayons and napkins to draw on for children I would draw Harry what he also doesn't talk like I don't actually believe that he is a real
GQ Videoseries,but it doesn't mean he's not important my cream every night you're probably wondering what's this guy doing at 9:30 p.m. is he in the gym getting shots ah is he collaborating with like Kanye West no putting cream on my face I don't know what it does but I'm normally so greasy but you know those things that yeah that like you buy it like a Walgreens where it's like a thin sheet of plastic and you put it on your face and it becomes clear and you can see how much grease you have before this cream if I put that on my face the the sheet would evaporate like you would actually like it would evaporate due to the grease I'm so greasy press your finger on my head and you're disgusted until this cream morning apply the cream night apply the cream you know I think you can see facially like I'm certainly coming into my own I'm like really I think thriving romantically sexually and I'm just ready to explode in 2020 so recently somebody sent me an oculus the tool that allows you to enter the three dimensional realm you know I knew there were like games to play on it and whatnot but the first
GQ Videoseries,I did like I'm sure everybody does is I looked into like VR porn that's the only reason this is here III don't do anything but watch porn on this I don't I know there's like a lot of cool things you can do I'm sure there's something great I could do with like the NBA like feel like you're courtside but really know this
GQ Videoseries,comes into play around of 12:30 a.m. every night and it's a real to do you know there's so many it's it's crazy it's really cool people were saying don't do this it's good you're gonna disappear from the face of the earth you're gonna stop dating no it has not replaced actual like romance or women it's just replaced two-dimensional masturbation water bottle seems simple but it's a constant because first off the worst
GQ Videoseries,that can ever happen to somebody I think is that they're thirsty I think like you mean if you died of thirst that would suck so I stand by that comment I think being thirsty is horrible obviously we're in the middle of a huge environmental crisis and like we shouldn't have plastic bottles around at all times that's so wasteful so I've got this old I call it my pink
GQ Videoseries,and fill it up with water it's um the technology isn't the same the water is cold it stays cold forever in this
GQ Videoseries,I could have cold water in it in the fridge take it out put it in the desert I think actually I'm not sure but it should I think it should thirsty right now actually like it just came out of the fridge last
GQ Videoseries,hi everyone I'm Charley Heaton and these are my essentials and you're going to pass me them and I'm going to talk about them all right this is a watch and I feel like every man needs like a good gentleman's watch I've had about three different watches this is a seventies Jaeger I was 18 and I got my sister's my dad to chip in for a birthday present for sixties watch it's been taken since like 1964 and then I ended up jumping in a pool with it and breaking it this is my third one it's a nice time for you soon it's nice don't look at your phone the whole time so you put your phone okay I'm describing to you what a watch it is this is crazy but yeah watch sunglasses these are both crew to brand I really like I just think these are really cool polarized lenses and yeah they're cool these are these and they're great and you know side a I don't know they're just some glasses but I know what to say I mean you can look at these I chew them so buy all the ends of these completely chewed off in the same with this one here yeah I'm really terrible with them they're pretty scratched as well I'm really bad at looking after sunglasses but you have any just cheering them while I'm kind of thinking just standing this is pretty like it's just a little special kind of
GQ Videoseries,I carry around with me it's a little type in with a boat on it my sister got me it for Christmas and she kind of wrote a note about it basically it's just a kind it's like a memento of like to remind me that life comes in waves like you know all kind of whatever you're doing it comes in waves so just to kind of you know keep that on you and yeah I thought was really sweet token sometimes I'll wear it on my first day of set just to keep me calm no I'll just literally like stuff it onto like you know a jacket or a jumper the most probably important essential that I own I am an avid Arsenal fan so wherever I am doesn't matter what time it is when they're playing but I have to get up for most the game I'm the first one because I'm from the altar so my dad and most of my family are Leeds fans I wasn't into football until I was roughly around 60 and I'd moved to London they were the first team that I watched and I used to play fifa a lot with my friends and they were the team that had always picked so they just naturally became my team we're not doing that great at the moment so it's kind of hard to be an Arsenal friend right now but I really like this jersey - am i calling it a jersey did I call it a jersey it's definitely a shirt a football shirt yeah this is my satchel bag again a gift for my sister from my 18th Christmas present and yeah I use it everyday and it's leather so it's great because the longer you use it the better against what's in it I mean mainly I'll just carry like my computer I always have a book right now it's Wonderland Avenue which is a dinosaur remember and a notebook which is just for Phinehas and my glasses the prescription lenses I've got shaver in here in a moment yeah these are my super goes again it's just something that I constantly carry around like you know my shoes will switch but I'll keep these and I'll just I mean they you know you can stick them in the wash or you just come they're relatively cheap so I just keep buying a new pair but I wear a lot of trousers and it's nice to kind of dress them down just a  shave or American cologne yeah I have to this is like the one that I've had been wearing since I was about 18 it's Prada melona it's kind of very clean and talky this one is the LA bosun foul which is something that I've just been introduced to and it's travel size my sister's boyfriend Rory and I used to steal it this is when I had no money and I used to steal everything that he had he lived upstairs so I steal his clothes and I started watch from him and steal his perfume and yeah when I first got one my first like paychecks it was one of the first things I bought but the
GQ Videoseries,about sense and which i think is amazing is it's no filter it goes straight to kind of is the brain and the memory bank so you smell like a specific perfume and you can be like walking down the street you smell something it'll remind you of that specific person they'll be walking up like a guy that smells like an ex-girlfriend anyway I was against getting beats because I know they're kind of really popular and you know there's such a well-known brand but I ended up buying them and they have changed my life and the best
GQ Videoseries,about these is the battery life they've got something like 36 hours of battery life so I charged them like once a month and they work great and they're kind of noise cancelling which is good like yeah everything that goes really quiet and also they're good if it's cold as well they have two zeros traveling I listen to music all the time so I pretty much have these around my neck  big faith something like yeah when I was younger I did I used to play in bands and my dad he's a big Beatles fan so I grew up on a lot of Beatles and then you kind of find your own way in music this is my electric toothbrush just traveling all the time you got to keep safely it's so much better than a manual and it changed my life and somebody bushing yeah yeah it's good night and morning two minutes each time it has a little
GQ Videoseries,on it actually where you it like vibrates a certain way when you want when you've done you two minutes so that's pretty cool thank you for checking out my essentials yeah thanks for watching
GQ Videoseries,GQ my essentials take one bro what's going on everybody I am Noah since now and I'm here with GQ today we're doing my essentials okay so here I got a I got a notebook this was a gift from from my manager actually it has my initials engraved in it and you see what manager gave me this because he knows that I love writing and journaling it's kind of a way that I can get my thoughts together because either they ricochet around a lot and I find them I like to like keep things in like I'm not really good at expressing my thoughts to other people so if I put them here then I can kind of structure and organize them a little bit if I'm if I'm like battling with something you know if I'm like really dealing with something that I'm struggling with you know it's just easier to write it down gotta have a wallet in this modern-day we uh you know you've all her re he's an Israeli author he's like a social scientist if you will he says that that money is like a mythology almost it's a story it's a narrative that's been told and it's a very strong one because the world runs on it right so economies form so if you don't have money and you're in a bind actually if you don't have money you might be in a bind that's probably they look like a cause for it as well so you got to have a way to way to pay but then again there are people that live with absolutely no money which is an interesting alternative lifestyle I keep I keep my I keep a credit card I keep a debit card I keep an ID I keep a a key that gets me to my managers crib just in case I want to like surprise him late night imminent spam and then I have a my insurance card
GQ Videoseries,is a passport I mean look it's a good form of ident identification and you never know when you just want to flee the country China yeah I did a project in China it's called the diary hasn't come out yet it's a Chinese language film crazy it was fortunate enough to get a 30 year visa to work in China is it a 10 I've been telling people it was 30 anyway my probably my favorite place that I I've been is up China I also went with my manager me and my manager have a very close relationship I love that dude yeah so 10 your visa to China it's pretty pretty pretty dope I always keep books with me this book is just what I'm reading currently I'm reading I read a script and I love the script a lot and the character in the script reads Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer and then he decides to move to Paris and be a writer and so I just wanted to read the book I was like damn like if this book could inspire some of them it was not a writer to move to Paris and be a writer that's pretty dope even if it's you know from the script this book was actually banned in America for a very long time like you weren't allowed to read it and now you can't and I'm not saying anyone should read this book I'm definitely not being like advocating for it but I'm thoroughly enjoying it so but this is my fiction so I got two books I get a nonfiction book and then I got a fiction book and the nonfiction is called the quants himself by dan and so har it's a really cool book that breaks down how science and like discoveries and science can influence the way that we perceive reality and look at other people and it's like science can influence the epistemology meaning that you know back in cartesian knowledge days like with Sir Isaac Newton you know everything is not connected so you have to separate objects I thought that and it impacts that one and I can also measure that however hard I throw this at the angle I throw it I know exactly where this book will end up which created in science when they learn that and they thought they that was the way it goes they believed that everything was determined so then something called determinism and when that came about people were like there's no point to anything there's nothing I can do I'm not in control of my life there's literally I got you know it's determined for me and that created this like kind of dark period of modernism it was great because we started making a lot of technological advances but it was bad because we kind of lost hope and being able to choose our own paths but then with quantum physics and new physics when that came out it was like wait a second things aren't really disconnected we just like think they're disconnected and really there's like that reality seems to be more unitary and abstract the farther in that we go it created this sense of connection between all things so how that could impact our culture and our philosophy and epistemology is maybe I shouldn't care about other people instead of just bouncing off of them maybe I should actually care and take into account that I can control my own life my own actions and instead of hurting other people or hurting myself I can learn from my mistakes and help other people and it's cool it's it's a great book about about about that not in a nutshell in a very long stream of conscious way of trying to describe what I'm reading so yeah I gotta have my fiction and my nonfiction this is a Nikon f3 it's a film camera which means like it open that it opens here and then it burns an image onto film it's not digital so you have to like change your settings to adjust for light if you prep the settings you probably won't make out the picture it won't look the way you want it to this is my second film camera I don't know man I just I like being able to document things my grandfather had Alzheimer's and he died from it so by the end of his life you never remembered anything so it would be really Nami not you know I hope that doesn't happen to me you know it does skip a generation so that's definitely very real fear but more than that I would like to be able to look back on my life when I'm like 80 years old the pictures that I took in that other people took and I like the way that film looks so they laid over it in digital if you could figure it out I suck so like all my photos don't turn out but you know what gotta have a phone you know I'm saying you don't have a phone you're kind of disconnected I like my phone because first and foremost I can like correspond with my friends and then second it's good you know

GQ Videoseries,it's gonna help you with that the next essential is headphones this is probably one of my favorites actually out of all the essentials just because music I love listening to music you can listen to music anywhere I constantly find myself using this essential probably more than most of the other essential other than the moisturizer that's it this is a hat I have read here sometimes you know when I go out in public it's good to cover up the carrot top just so I can keep it a little okay if you know what I'm talking about the specific cat is one of my favorite heads to but any head will do it from outside I love this hat it's green it's just a hat obey worldwide but any hat like I said any hair work as long as it covers the red okay the next essential that we have is a watermelon it happens to be my favorite food I used to take watermelons to school every day with me in my backpack and that was my lunch I used to cut it open and just eat it straight straight from the

GQ Videoseries,always bringing headphones on the road I'm not a big air pod guy I'm addicted to noise canceling headphones these bows really good at kind of they're not that cool when you have air pods that cool if you like rich right these you got on your neck when you put these on you literally can't hear anything else music sounds so good on these like a mix records in these I can vibe out with them this is another set of this is actually my friend started a company called silent mode and these you put on when you take on a red-eye flight you could actually open this up and move the speaker to fit your head perfectly so it's same as a noise cancelling pair of headphones but it's got a total blackout mass that's comfortable you can sleep with this you know if you have your phone you have a different apps where you can listen to the relaxing sounds or even like you know heavy metal if you want to I always bring a book as a bookmark I have my sons it so I can always keep him close even though there's a bunch of pictures on my phone too but I was taught to read this book yet so kid type is good or not but Willie Nelson super cool I love books about musicians and historical figures and I love non-fiction books like the sapiens Home Videos and Howard Zinn and maybe about history culture never met Willie Nelson I want to get him to send me a package of his marijuana though Lily's reserve it's pretty good stuff I her snip dog says Willie Nelson's the only guy that can out smoke him so that's kind of a big accomplishment how's the hook shot this is Opie one this is made by a company called teenage engineering actually comes with a case that's similar to like the velcro of the sleeping mask and this
GQ Videoseries,is so cool it's very very sturdy it's got my name on it because people trust steel from Studio for a while they're really into man you know they only made a couple hundred of them and I got it really early from the Swedish company makes them you can literally do because sequence on here you can I use a MIDI keyboard ROM on the road  you do so many things on this she has a million presets you can always install more sounds on it so it's always able to upgrade when you look at the screen it's really beautiful tools all the different things that have like years effects to go to the drum settings to presets anyway it's hard to learn it's a really big learning curve because it's a different DW than anything else a we use but you have to get a book and download it and print it and taxing on how to use it I will unlock like 10% of what this does so if I had more time I'd love to like learn this
GQ Videoseries,and just kill it but for just making music sounds on the road this is perfect this is all my stuff this is a dosis pen so this is a pen that's a little more heavier on THC less on CBD and you smoke this time to be smoked one hit it buzzes it even buzzed this time only get too high I got to do this whole photo shoot so it buzzes next one hit so you can kind of like calculate how much you need to either sleep or get worked on or no cuz if you're just like rolling joints all the time you don't really know what you know how much you're smoking or what you're doing this is also good to sleep this is a company called ki cocoa they make it tea that's a CBDT that really like knocks you I don't feel high from it I drink that when I'm on the road and there's my vitamins I took three day three packs take this this times like three almost fifteen vitamins a day and then I mix the lead to you know to the kiss I'm on the road I want to store it but I'll be legal across borders with that but whenever I was crazed I'm a rock star face moisturizer all the Henrickson's a great company to make a lot of different things for face mask to serums to just regular old moisturizer in the day so sunscreen this was a good i do supply got like although my face right now all right this is i'm looking like a pretty boring dad right here like nothing exciting i'll have that many changed but i keep them with me a good cube legs have a couple pair i think they're different like layers on my neck they look nice when you wear kind of Wester shirts that are open and cowboy hat something like rock and that stop a little bit it looks nice it's mice box from atlanta i wore some stuff by the VMAs a multicolored rainbow different gemstone cable makes chain I'm not really a big jewelry person but I like like Cuban links um I think that gets there yeah I have a couple of watches black said never wear I think watches are actually good investments Jane's not so much it's hard to resell it but watch this middle high some out get reselling for more if you got like a nice thick or Rolex well I'm like the dad am like time to tell you like can buy a watch as an investment not like just to show off to your friends though alright what else is exciting over there you know what bring over the wisps these are great I let's say right now I don't like the fact that they're single-use plastic you gotta brush your teeth as much as possible guys three times a day all right if you don't brush your teeth every day I'm gonna find out where you live I'm gonna beat your ass I'm telling you right now brush your teeth if you can't go to the gas station by these cuz they're little tooth brushes that you use once the problem with these is that you start getting too comfortable using them and you like walking around using them like in public and it's kind of disgusting I'm kind of I do that sometimes it's a little bit of toothpaste I think in the gel here and it just kind of breaks in when you when it's wet when your saliva and then you can floss with this side rush or this side breath smells great dr. girls you don't have like piece of spaghetti your new teeth this is a girl munities she taught me how to meditate so when I hold these in two different hands you kind of do your matches and I listen to her voice and she speaks we do it a little six seven minute kind of coaching my meditation so I'll do it enough I wish you'd do more meditation but I'll chime the line a lot of my friends are producers of musicians I'll bet it's a like Mark Ronson's a really big into Transcendental Meditation so I wish I could do more of it and I think that it helps you if your life is chaotic to kind of ground yourself and give you guys some more time that you need people told me actually Kutcher told me once that he meditates for 20 minutes and it says to give them two more extra hours of sleep every night but he doesn't get I got tells me weird stuff that when I stand that guy's like insane whatever he does he's doing the right

GQ Videoseries,essential adjectives absolutely necessary extremely important that is what we're talking about today hi I'm Nick Jonas and these are my essentials my first cellphone was a Nokia brick where you could change out to face the phone it had the snake game on it no color screen eventually from there I upgraded to a sidekick and I held onto that til I got to the black bear I've sort of fancied myself a businessman at the age of 15 and was reluctant to make the switch to the first generation iPhone and then I got all the way up to the 6 and stayed there until just recently I was gifted this phone the 11 which for some reason has three cameras four if you include the front and it's again a life changing experience and connects me with my family my friends and my amazing fans all over the world there have been crucial moments where not having my cell phone on me was an obstacle but actually story comes to mind about my brother and him not having his phone on him this was Joe we're big skier some snowboarder he's too scared and we were on the mountain and he had a a white case on his phone he at the top of the mountain decided to enjoy a little and as he was on his way down his phone fell out of his pocket he was trying to take a picture and he said I'm done I'm too high to go down this mountain again it's up to you and I said I will save a day I will find your white phone I'm it's this white snowy mountain I then rode down and like something out of a movie this guy was stopped and he looked injured I said hey are you okay and he looked up he said is this your phone forty thousand square feet of space on this white mountain and the one guy I ran into was the guy holding my brother's phone I didn't tell him till nup just now obviously that I had help but I did save a day and he has me to thank and just so you know he's not high anymore my friend introduced me to one of the finer things in life and no I'm not talking about excellent tequila which we'll get to later I'm talking about low mercury too now this is delicious it comes in various flavors tandoori lemon pepper Cajun lots of great flavors and I fancy myself a bit of a canned tuna aficionado if you will I've posted many videos and tutorials on how to make your own much like a makeup tutorial although it's tuna fish instead of makeup I had the pleasure of being a part of this film the first iteration of the Jumanji franchise which were about to release the second one I was actually watching the original one with Robin Williams on a tour bus the day I got the phone call that I had been cast in the movie so a little serendipitous and to this day that is still one of my favorite movies in the fact that I get to be a part of this franchise now was really special one of the things to look out for in this film is there's one particular scene where Kevin Hart is crying unnecessarily in the scene you know he cries all the time obviously but this was on camera and it's in the movie where we were shooting up the mountains and it was so cold the wind was blowing in his face and so when it did this cutaway shot halfway through the film which you'll see if you go check it out in theaters he's literally crying and all of us are crying laughing at him crying on-screen and I just got the most joy out of that possible I should text him now and tell him he's a great crier  my job requires me to to work a lot and travel a lot which means I'm not in my own bed a lot of time and I was on a plane once and I looked over at this very elegant man the most elegant man I've ever seen in my life he walked on with a kind of briefcase he walked on with a duffle bag and he sat the briefcase down first opened it up and pulled out an eye mask his own cashmere blanket and some earplugs he then put the duffel bag up top proceeded to tuck himself into bed on this flight put the eye mask on and look like it had been done professionally that flight was over I looked over again and realized it was none other than Tom Ford the most elegant person I've ever seen and he slept in his suit which I also thought was very impressive whereas I looked like you know like a garbage person basically after that I said I'm gonna find myself a good sleeping mask the cool part about this one is that it's actually open here right so it doesn't pressure your eyes crucial spoken from a a true eye mask aficionado I don't know where I came across this but I never leave my house without it speaking of Tom Ford I just recently purchased this portfolio it's sort of a clutch meets a handbag I guess but the important
GQ Videoseries,is that it elevates everything so I could be wearing a t-shirt have this with me suddenly it looks like I actually put in some work to get out the house the morning or if I have it with a suit it fits that as well it doesn't have to be Tom Ford he's just my inspiration because he's the most elegant man I've ever met this was a splurge I made recently after the tour and seeing the fans every night and how amazing that was so I said you know what I need a new bag I've had the same one for a while and it treats me pretty well plus it looks really cool when you do this bag and then zip it back up so thanks Tom Ford for all the inspiration for the portfolio bag for those of you that don't know that's what it's called support folio bag tequila a man's best friend not always the morning after necessarily but in the moment it is for sure and with this one it's my best friend because I co-created this this brand with John Barbados a very good friend of mine and collaborator we'd always had interest in tequila and wanting to build something together starting with clothing collaboration and moving on to the fragrance and then after all these dinners and things we've been to together where we talked about life and family and connectivity and artistry at the center a lot of those conversations was tequila we said we're not we're not professionals we don't know much about this but we know that we have an eye for the way we move design the brand and you know we've drank enough of it to know what we would want it to taste like so we went to a Stoli group and talked with them about developing his brand they had just actually purchased a distillery a couple months earlier so the timing was perfect and within you know eighteen months of getting the juice just right we've got the design concept for the bottle which this is our Reposado we've got a silver end in the D at home for me tequila is is sort of like champagne in a sense you drink that with friends at times you're celebrating when life is good and we wanted to bring that same energy and idea around tequila which is that it's life as it should be it should be with people that you love and for me my brother's my wife this is what we drink and whether you're celebrating or not hopefully you're around people when you drink this because it's not good to drink alone but this is this is good essential to have in moderation of course this is a perfect segue here to Bro mask now I don't like gender stereotypes at all and I think it's important to recognize that this is a product that is specifically catered towards men right bro mask but this is something men and women can both use and it is very helpful I don't know the science necessarily behind it but I know that I feel a lot better after I wear this and this started because you know I was regularly stealing my wife's products and and she was stealing some of my products and then someone that I work with very closely who helps me with my hair and feeling groomed before I stepped into things said once you try this one and this is made by a husband and wife who have a similar story where the husband was stealing wife's products and finally they developed this together and I just love that sort of was a parallel to my own life finding a way to to make men that perhaps do feel uncomfortable sort of taking extra care of their skin and other things because of unfortunate gender stereotypes I think this is a good starting place for you or you'll feel a lot better you'll look your best just good to take care of yourself that's the reality whether you're a man or a woman non-binary take care of yourself feel your best your body will thank you so bro mask for me is the way to go and for someone else might be something else but this is my essential in addition to taking care of yourself it's important to smell good I did a Broadway show a couple years ago called How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying I took over for Daniel Radcliffe and then Darren Criss came in for a while now I had this weird sense of competition with both those guys who I really love and admire and have really great friendships with but the competition was not so much about the show that we all played that same role in but more about our cast mates telling us who smelled the best so when I teamed up with John Varvatos I told him the same story said well why don't we do a fragrance and you can actually hold the title as best smelling man in show business and I said what an idea we launched the blue fragrance first then a micro Maroons were red fragrance that came out last holiday season and this is our newest one it's sort of electric if you had to think of a word to describe it it's got a lot of energy I think it immediately pops and has an effervescence about it that makes you kind of want to know more about not only the fragrance itself but the person this fragrance to me is all about challenging yourself I will say this was inspired by New York the energy of the city by the artistry and the creativity within that city both from again its look and its smell if you smell it I think you know what I'm talking about it'll make you want to get up and do something and I like making good first first impressions and this does that but this isn't essential because I make money from it marriage and this ring is that the token of forever goes back many many many many thousands of years I believe my Wikipedia page that pulled up before this is accurate this one specifically was a gift from my wife as was hers from me although I've named all these things as essentials I try to live without ever really needing any material
GQ Videoseries,and knowing that if it was stolen from me or if I ever had to give it away to somebody or if it was you know misplaced somehow that I wouldn't be crushed however this would be pretty devastating as it sort of represents the greatest achievement of my life which is finding someone that I love care about deeply I wouldn't spend my life with for those that don't know that's what a reading wedding ring means it's the ring that you get on your wedding day so I'm glad I can help you understand that hopefully you get one of these one day - if that's what you want if not no pressure spike ball it's a game played by four or more people with a ball this net and a whole lot of can-do attitude the idea is simple it's basically volleyball meets doubles table tennis and it looks like a sport for someone that's just done a keg stand perhaps it's got a sort of a real fraternity energy to it in the best way in that it's all about you know sort of just throwing a ball at a net very simple concept but my brothers and I really come to love this while on tour and it's a good warm-up for us it's not a highly athletic sport necessarily although I'm sure there's a lot of people who disagree with me on the Internet it will take it very seriously for us it's more just an enjoyable way to kill some time and although our skills are getting better I would say for the rest of the world probably watching this at home who aren't in deep deep you know tournament style spike both games just get one of these very easy to get outside of cup of friends hit the ball around see if you can take home that the spike ball pride for us you know it's easy to travel with although right now trying to show this as proven to be a little awkward those are my essentials thank you for watching

GQ Videoseries,everybody knows you put it on you just can't be dry the next ten seconds and the W is great because they have the Bliss lotion and I think that's finished it's absolutely fantastic it smells like Venus brothers books with dry skin black folks W is good lotion I might be able to put a little image of everyday but um I like shea butter like cocoa butter and I like an idiot those are my three favorite floors get orange on something like some bougie  smells like a hotel it smells like a nice hotel like the lobby of a nice hotel I know very specific right but that's what I thought lotion another great essential very essential musician but these are for listening to podcasts nice it's the funny
GQ Videoseries,about it is I like to keep headphones on me I'm broke I have regular headphones knowing apart sorry keep losing I like to listen to other things I like to listen I like talk radio parks and stuff like that just to take me out of music for a little bit but I'll keep these two get away and then I plug these into my switch when in case nobody wants to hear like river city girls screaming loud and kicking and punching I get into my zone with my total blast ah listen to Jose doing some turns even though I kind of try to stay away from the music stuff but I listen to whatever I could find sports you know I listen to the Will Ferrell anchorman run a couple times and then sometimes I'll just browse Apple whatever I feel like listening to yeah yeah I mean I got the best album of the year so I listen to it a lot for some reason I don't think I listen to my music as much as other artists let's say how many does that make sense I mean these are the probably the most honest ones because you know that's why most people are gonna digest music just didn't have phones like this scrunchie headband whatever tomato tomahto but normally I keep a black one I didn't need one today book and I think I've got the crown one today this is just to get my hair on my face and I don't even put it in a pretty ponytail some time to the side to the front just I don't feel like all these these locks on my wood and I just you know keep it on me sometime this because I I stopped with this but what he's it easy to lose track of so god get him impacts it like 50 anything like there wasn't like a pair of my jeans probably had to use one of these five for like past like seven years probably a lady from harlem did my hair yesterday before the show and you know I normally get my hair down in DC LA New York or Miami when it's fancy my wallet is pretty interesting so this is a Balenciaga wallet but you can barely read the lines think it was silver at one point shiny silver with red letters and now it just looks like it's been in the muffler for like like a month and as character though I used to be a designer while announces Yaga nectar all over it I have a nando's black card which means I can eat free Nando's whenever however as much as I want for a long time Nando's is essential the Nando's is delicious this is really good um I can't wait to go back the episode where they're on every corner and I'm in London um I had a Dave & Buster's car to here but there's not only no more while it always an essential I want to say this is essential what I knew I was gonna go come see some fly individuals today so I just said I can show it on this morning sometimes you know I just like to throw some diamonds on sometimes I love anymore like I take a more humble approach which is not just trying felt loved me and I just felt like I want it on today why not work tomorrow my question for the most part good style is essential but nowadays when I go to the airport man the first more things I put on as long as I have a hoodie in some shades I just wear but one of my regular day-to-day being flies essentially I got this Jason to Beverly Hills it wasn't cheap you gotta cheat yourself sometimes I forgot where I got these but a lot of people don't know this but I don't I don't have no fulfilling in these three fingers so I don't really switch my earrings that much you know and it's difficult to like I need help taking things on and off though but I keep I keep my everything going oh I got a purse when I go my daughter got her his peers she was early on she was only like a couple months old when she got him but I saw her like I was like okay let me see what they're about to do to my child oh I got it first oh really I mean I was I was it hurt me just to see her cry when they when they did it she got her almost cry for her the album was essential wow that's crazy very very essential wow that's crazy that's essential a lot of people call that a healing out or growth I'm saying and that's that's important that's essential to everybody's wellness you know
GQ Videoseries,so this is one of my essential items um i carry this around because i found this on a movie set one day and it's really cool because whenever you want to like end the conversation with someone you just go you know i'll be like hey let's start the conversation about how you owe me money and action hey what's up everybody i'm trevor noah comedian and host of the daily show and these are my essentials  first
GQ Videoseries,my electric toothbrush i know it doesn't seem like an essential
GQ Videoseries,but this is my real toothbrush this is my road dog see those scars look at that there's battle scars that's traveling that's ohio that one over there is tucson and one of there's austin power oscillating pulsating i used to brush my teeth with a normal toothbrush and then when you discover this it's like moving from a horse carriage to a car that's what life is all about you forget to brush your brush twice as hard the next day that's what i do all day every day my grandfather used to say to me he said trev if you don't brush you brush when you can that's what i've been doing ever since brushing as much as i can there are a few things in my life i consider more essential than headphones these are easily my favorite things ever i think bose has done the greatest job of creating noise cancelling headphones if you fly you know what it's like to have a baby crying these no baby like i even forgot that i had a baby on the flight i left the baby behind then they called me later they're like yo did you leave a baby and i was like oh snap and then i came back then i realized it wasn't my baby and i was like what just happened here that's how good these headphones are and then these are great little airpod pros they go straight into your ear these are great for like short trips you know like a little 15 15-minute noise cancellation
GQ Videoseries,i see some people wearing them in the streets in new york and i don't do that because i don't want to die you got to hear what's happening in new york because sometimes like a bicycle is flying by sometimes cars jump the curb it doesn't happen a lot but it's enough for me to not want to noise cancel i want to hear my death coming i'm not going to avoid the death but i just want to be able to be like  this is an essential if you live in a city where there is rain california you can skip this part i know you guys don't know what rain is but the rest of the world as a little kid i loved umbrellas i loved mary poppins i loved spies that could shoot umbrella things you know like they shoot the little
GQ Videoseries,so i found one of these this is my essential it's an umbrella that opens the other way it's like magic look at this huh what what what what what you see that other way and then when you're getting into a car you just do this move you just do this and then i meet people at my destination and they're like oh weren't you in the rain then i'm like no i was but i had my essentials and that's why i'm good and you're not  this is just an essential i don't like traveling with a laptop it's too cumbersome it's heavy on my back also don't like just having like a tablet because then sometimes websites are just like are you using a big phone then i'm like no i'm using like a big device i want to see the full website but then they don't want you to see the website so this is a surface pro x and it's basically a tablet if i need it to be one and then it's a laptop if i need it to be one and then what's cool is that i have my little pen that hides on the inside over here see that has a little camera which i don't use i don't ever understand how people use the cameras on these things it looks a bit weird taking photos like but it's nice to have a device because it makes you feel like a professional and then when people see you typing they're like wow what is that person doing you know this whole
GQ Videoseries,yeah but if you on this side you would see all i'm typing is google how fast can superman fly wow  this lip balm is easily like one of the most essential things in my life i have one of these everywhere i've tried like a bunch of things but i like the bliss deck specifically just because i feel like it stays on your lips for long some chapstick feels like a scam you know what i mean like some of the like you put like a lip balm on and then it feels like it makes your lips dry so you need more and i find this doesn't do that they say it's medicated as well i don't know what that means but i just like the sound of anything medicated just a quick tip though it's gonna break when you drop it that always happens see that over there but that's i mean that's life you know i'd rather have cracked lid than crap lips simple essential this is one of the quirkiest essentials that i own i think it's one of the most underrated pieces of technology that's ever been invented a pair of glasses known as spectacles and these were made by snapchat they may not be everybody's style but i love them when i travel because when i'm on vacation i don't always like to have my phone out i feel like it takes you out of the moment so what's great about these is you can wear them and you can just like press a little button see over there and right now i'm recording you recording me like i've used these when i was fishing for piranhas in in the amazon jungle uh i've used these when i was like like hiking through peru and what's great is you don't stick your phone in people's faces because that's what i hate about like traveling a lot of the time is people just you know also makes me feel like a spy because deep down inside i'll always be 11 years old this is what's known as project xcloud i have been playing video games since the very beginning since i knew how to use my hands my mom was a pac-man champion a lot of people don't know that and so whenever i leave the house i always regret that i don't have my console it's a service from xbox where you play all your games like at home or just any game you want wherever you are so i'll be like playing like a full-on driving game i'll be playing gears of war if i've got internet i can play like a real game you know what i mean by like a real game like if you play video games you know what i'm talking about i'm i'm not like a fan of like the mobile version of a game i want to play the real
GQ Videoseries,and so this is it by the way people who play video games in movies and tv shows stop doing this that's not real that's not a real
GQ Videoseries,video games people are very calm most of the time when you're really playing a video game this is what it sounds like that's real this has become an essential in my life i suffered a vocal cord injury a few months ago hemorrhagic polyps and my doctor told me it's because my voice gets too dry that's from a lot of flying that's from not drinking enough water etc and so i got one of these a portable humidifier like makes steam whenever i fly on like up every few hours i'll just use this i put this over my face it like lubricates everything and then it's like cool and if you're on a flight where people can choose their seats no one will sit next to you because you look like you're going to infect everybody on the plane so i just sit there and everyone i'm like please join me join me nobody sits next to you one final
GQ Videoseries,my timepiece grew up in a home where i always loved watches my father is swiss so it's almost a prerequisite he would bring me two things from switzerland every time he would come back home to south africa he'd bring me a watch and he would bring me the chocolates and so i've loved collecting and this is easily my most essential piece if i had to keep one watch in one watch alone it would be this patek philippe 5650g the advanced research one of the most beautiful pieces ever made in my opinion it's got all of the work of a patek philippe a beautiful design but at the same time it doesn't take itself too seriously you know you've got this like fun rubber strap you can wear it whenever you want you've got the open face i don't know if you can see that right you don't see that on any other particularly this was the first time where they showed you a few of the internals of their timepiece i'm not a big fan of like diamond watches or anything i think that's weird because i actually want to tell the time but i want to look down and be like what's the time diamond past two so this is one of my essentials and it reminds me of my dad because that's what we always shared was a love of time and time keeping and if you know any swiss people you'll know that it's not a passion it's what they have in their bones they're obsessed with time a bit crazy if you ask me i just like the watches  well that's my essentials thank you so much for having me gq and thank you for watching if you like any of the stuff i have you can send an email to my website and i won't be able to help you but i will now have your mailing address which i will use to invite you to all of my comedy shows don't email me actually i regret saying that don't email me about any of these items please
GQ Videoseries,fun tip reapply if you want no do it is there like an intro I'm Dan levy and these are my first up I am a writer so it's integral that I have something to write on and this is my macbook and it's real thin which means I can store it quickly or just grab it and go which I mean I'm not being chased often so I don't really need to grab and go but it's thin and like I use final draft which is a pretty standard screenwriting software but I also use notes I just got into like dictation on the phone on the computer and the phone so now I just like say things and it types for me hi I'm from 1965 speaking of writing apparatus my
GQ Videoseries,is my notebook if you are a writer this is an essential I think you need your technology but you also need something very practical to just nothing like pen on paper you know what I mean I keep this by the bed because oftentimes when I'm falling asleep I never fall asleep I'm an insomniac I will come up with ideas as I'm sort of drifting off and I need something quick to jot the notes down so oftentimes there's like a pen in here and a lot of scratch and then I'll wake up in the morning and not be able to read any of it because oftentimes I write in the dark so if you are going to take notes in the night turn the light on that's the first step and this particular notebook has a lot of sentimental value to me because it was a prop in my store on my show and my show is now finished so this means a lot there's about 10 pages in here of top secret ideas let's see if they go anywhere we'll do a follow-up in a year and see what happens nice leather-bound notebook if you are a writer invest in one  next essential the diptych Tokyo candle now this is gonna be a weird brag this candle is only available in Tokyo so whenever I like to travel I try to find things that are unique to the place and it's hard to bring back delicious food from Japan so this is always a very special gift that I will bring back for myself and some friends it also happens to be my favorite scent out of this collection of candles so I try to collect them I think it's pretty special I think if you know anyone in Japan or if you ever visit Japan a worthwhile investment a great gift and always impresses at a dinner party when you show up with something that nobody else has let's open it up now I am NOT a perfumer so I'm gonna give you a description of this smell based on my college dropout education okay it's clean smells like fresh laundry I think there's lavender in there probably not it basically smells like you've archived clean human you know what I mean I think for me my favorite smells are that of just hygiene general hygiene and this candle when lit in your home makes you smell clean  speaking of being clean my
GQ Videoseries,this is a travel mist and for those of you that aren't plagued with a fear of germs and getting sick skip past this
GQ Videoseries,but this is essentially a general disinfectant for airplanes I'm pretty sure that you can use this everywhere but they seem to be making money off of this being specific to an airline so great this was sent to me a long time ago and I have used it religiously ever since simple spray it says shake well so I will and basically once you get to your seat in the airplane or you know if you don't like the person sitting beside you just everywhere and it apparently disinfects not just the space but the air as well so I've just told you all of deep dark secret about myself but there are a lot of people who are into airplane hygiene fun tip reapply if you want next essential these are matchstick incense they are perfect for a bathroom a bedroom they're perfect to throw into a piece of luggage if you travel a lot again I found these in Japan I go there often so it's another little secret surprise and essentially you take them out light it up let it burn it comes with like a little disc I don't have it here but the actual kit comes like a little disc so then you blow it out and it's a delicious Japanese Cypress scent and if you're having guests over I often like to put them by the toilet in case of any kind of emergency let the guests feel comfortable in times of need but it is a delightful smell and they last for 10 minutes and sometimes if you're traveling and you are staying at an Airbnb that's really smelly and you want to make it smell just too smelly but like good Meli witchcraft very worthwhile affordable and for those of you that enjoy the incense experience it is a delicious flavor Japanese Cypress they come in a bunch of different flavors hibi they do good they do good work essential Joan Didion slouching towards Bethlehem my favorite of all of her books and I include this because I feel like while this might be my favorite it is important for everyone to have a book in their essentials list and for me as a writer she is someone that inspires me a lot she's able to articulate her life and observances and very thoughtful and interesting and left-of-center ways so I always like to have one of the books around because in times of need I will turn to it for inspiration and motivation so books essentials next essential okay this is a bit of a splurge but to me I feel like this essential covers a lot of faces so if you want to splurge this is a great investment this is a pair of prada slacks they are a technical fabric slim fit pant and I got them not really thinking anything of it put them on and not only are they incredibly flattering they've certainly given me an ass and I normally just have a back that splits into legs so thank you to these pants for doing that but also they are an amazing dress pant but they're also a great everyday pant and to me that's a twofer so you're buying a pant that covers a lot of bases you can wear them with a blazer and a shirt and a tie and some great shoes out for a night on the town you can wear them with some converse and a t-shirt like I like to do they come in like I think this is a navy sorry I think these are just two shades of black ones just a little bit lighter you don't need to do what I did and buy to the same pair but pick one and I promise you not only will you live in them but you will be thanking me when you ever run into a situation where you have to go from day to night very quickly great great great investment if you can swing it second investment
GQ Videoseries,in the essentials list these are a loafer made by the way they these are my favorite they're in a brown sort of embossed crock I believe and the back goes down so you can wear them really casually or sort of keep the back up and wear them as a traditional loafer I always like to sort of cover all my bases I can wear these dress-up I can wear them dress down I can wear them shorts and a shirt if I'm on vacation they can just you know gets thrown into a bag and they're a nice alternative to a sandal they're a nice alternative to like a chuck and they just you know they sort of make you look like you know what you're doing so for those of us that don't know what we're doing these are a great investment to trick people into believing the opposite next essential is my dog which at this point I guess is sort of would we call him a life partner I don't know best friend confidant he has been around for all six seasons of my show and I feel like the great
GQ Videoseries,about he's a rescue you're going to get a pet I highly encourage you to rescue one many sites that you can go to to rescue animals and he's a dachshund and a Corgi mix which I believe is the Queen's breed I think the Queen actually originated the Dorji and then speaking of a baller move when her last dog died she did not read it again because she doesn't want anyone else to have her breed of dog after she dies that is absolute gossip but something that I believed to be true this little guy changed my life so this is read Redmond is his full name and he's pretty great so he is one of my essentials and hopefully will be until he's 900 years old I would like to die long before him  okay so this is arguably going to be the most divisive essential on my essentials list when I am in dark times often times I will turn to bubbles eating now people at home are probably saying Dan you're disgusting I'm changing the channel that's fair a lot of people agree with you I don't know I can't I don't know what to say I always turn to a bubble tea when I need one the most now these are not my flavors but they are for somebody I prefer a traditional black milk tea with a normal tapioca pearl and a pearl is what button bubble tea drinkers refer to as the bubbles at the bottom of the glass you'll get to know they'll vocabulary the more you wade into the waters of bubble tea land I'm gonna try this one this seems to have like an apricot pearl which scares me a bit I'm not gonna lie oh absolutely not nope oh they explode okay don't get the ones that explode in your mouth that has some sort of jam inside that just burst in my mouth and I'm feeling light-headed I would recommend a black milk tea with the traditional tapioca pearl I guess I like poke do we have to amend this I guess so we're making a quick amendment to that last
GQ Videoseries,I have since learned that boba and bubble are two different things bubble is what I was drinking I do not love bubble tea I like boba tea boba are the tapioca pearls so that's the latest with me and you know I yes a black milk boba tea no offense to bubble tea drinkers I am a boba tea drinker I've now learned so baba tapioca pearls bubbles pop in your mouth okay I like a boba tea last essential I can't do the like Mac Wireless any er things they always pop out I honestly don't know whose ears are built for those little things because I take one step and those things are flying out of my ears so these are the Bose wireless in-ear headphones they sort of have a wire they can there's like something that like makes them stick in your ear it's like a more ergonomic
GQ Videoseries,you can really find them anywhere but the Bose are my favorites wear them every single day I walk a lot i podcast a lot I like to listen to everything on my trips what's on my playlist right now I was like last night I was really enjoying like a Fleetwood Mac radio a lot of your parents favorite hits are coming up on that like the Eagles a Steely Dan I just got back to California so I'm feeling like some nice California anthems you know in-ear wireless headphones a nice alternative to what comes with your phone and the case is a lot bigger and charges itself so you won't necessarily lose that little pill case that those the other ones come in well that was it these are my essentials hope you enjoyed hope you live laughs and loved with me see you next time
GQ Videoseries,Table six now Lauren GQ essentials soft sticks you're welcome what's up GQ it's Niall Horan here and these are my essentials I like navy blue can you guess he did thanks for sorry about the length of this this Dyson hairdryer best
GQ Videoseries,that ever happened I've got quite crazy hair so I needed something that helps me control the madness any sort of humidity I would never be able to live in New York City for instance so this
GQ Videoseries,is vital this goes everywhere with me I even have one for America one for the UK so I don't have to switch around with y'all adapters and the power and stuff this Dyson one my barber in the UK Larry thought he used all of these in his salon and he gave me this one so I can bring it all over the world and make sure that it looks half decent that is essential number one for sure essential number two Sarah Chapman facemask paper mask Sarah Chapman is a lady who works in London mostly skin in skin care linen paper masks get a bit moisture in there do a lot of traveling spend a lot of time on planes so the skin dries out a little bit you know it got to be on camera all the time and these things are a must for moisturizing your skin in the evening and based on my first two I sound really vain I'm just plenty more where I came from on the topic of moisturizing Hydra flasks these have become a bit of a
GQ Videoseries,recently it's basically an extension of my arm I like to drink a lot of water I don't really drink soft drinks generally and I bring these everywhere mainly because recently I've gotten into trying to help in whatever way I can save the planet I'm know like eco-warrior but I feel like this is my start so these are a must drink water save the planet and they look half decent essential number four the guitar Thank You square this is my personal guitar that happens to be in tune even though I didn't do that I roll basically my last two albums on this
GQ Videoseries,I played on stage every night on my Flickr world tour last year it's by an Irish brand called Loudon and they hand make all the guitars they don't sell that many guitars a year based on how much pride they put into the woods that they choose and I got to sit down with them and kind of make this edge here and use them sometimes if I'm just watching TV I'll be I'd be just kind of practicing and just kind of sitting there just kind of fiddling around with it and if there was no guitars and my house it would be a very boring house so I'm glad that I was able to take up this instrument as a kid and it makes some sweet tones essential but like me the guitar
GQ Videoseries,sunglasses it's a most any type of sunglasses these ones are faults mate but generally it can I wear whatever I like wearing sunglasses a lot obviously because it's sunny I've got sensitive IDs I'm wearing them indoors right now and I don't really know why you bought one camera so I might as well I just like wearing sunglasses I like trying out different ones different shapes see if they suit me obviously they're good for when you're out and about and I can wear a hat and glasses and just kind of keep the head down you probably won't even recognize me now would you also one
GQ Videoseries,I do have in my favor is that I don't have the blonde hair anymore so people actually still think I have blonde hair even though I haven't had blonde hair for five years so people always know of me as a little blonde fellow with the Irish accent things have changed around here
GQ Videoseries,baseball cap not gonna put it on now because I just did my hair in America people get very touchy about what team it is can't wear that head around here son a lot of kind of stuff but I can don't know many American sports or teams so this is obviously one of the most famous logos in the world and we're in New York so I do tend to wear this one a lot they're really good for when I need to keep my head down again it's like sunglasses I could probably walk around Times Square in that and I probably will we've got a billboard there right now and I want to go and see it amongst all the other tourists to came to New York and bought a New York he's at baseball cap always essentially their main essential golf clubs anyone that knows me whether you know me or not you know one
GQ Videoseries,about me I play golf and golf clubs are a big one for me I always bring them everywhere everywhere I go people don't know if I'm a musician or a goal for these days because I walk out of airports with golf clubs I have a golf management company where I manage young European golfers with a minute and yeah they're good friends with the guys at Taylor Made and they make up my clubs for me fit moat for me some of my favorite golf courses I've played st. Andrews the home of golf in Scotland royal Portrush where the Open Championship was this year I was also very very fortunate to be invited Augusta National the home of the Masters Tournament for many years money can't buy your way in there you have to be invited in as you can see from television it's pretty spectacular my favorite place in the world are none I don't want to go on about all the great course template but I've been looking enough to play in some pretty cool golf course and if you're a gulfs nerd like me you can appreciate what I've just said for the last 30 seconds
GQ Videoseries,a very important one this is a Paul Smith suit I'm good friends with Paul Smith himself great man this particular suit is one that I brought especially for today because I wore this suit to the American Music Awards a few years ago when I won Best New Artist still probably my favorite tune that I've ever worn it's got like a little tartan kind of check number going on and what I love about Paul Smith is he always puts all these crazy colors on the inside of the jacket and like even back the pocket is a different color he always does something really cool with his suits and I'm lucky enough to know the guy and now when I look inside the inside of his jacket I understand because his personality matches exactly what he's tailored every suit that I put on has to be Paula Smith and if it's not Paula Smith I feel like I'm cheating on the guy next date of a hand steamer I think I got this one on tour last year probably in Walmart or something like that on the road I'm not very good at ironing so I basically got this

GQ Videoseries,I wanted to bring was my laptop which I have this GQ sticker on cuz I'm a big fan of GQ to produce a song I think a lot of people think you need a lot of gear and I don't know for me like I just need a laptop that's pretty much it there's a couple songs on the last EP of mine a couple songs I've done for other artists that I've literally like priests on flights using the actual keys of the laptop to like play chords and then orchestrating everything else and all I need is a laptop to produce a song this is my Apple watch this was like a compulsive retail therapy by a couple years ago for me and when I got it I was like why did I get this and then I just sort of wore it every day for a couple months and now like when I forget to wear it looked down at my like bare wrist all the time this also has a really great microphone and you can like record low like voice memos straight into here she's pretty awesome but the the best feature of this is that you can ring your phone from it and I lose my phone four to five thousand times a day so it's pretty awesome just feel like where's my phone and then you know where it is this band is from a website called case 2phi this was a present from my my girlfriend this much classier than the the fake Gucci one that I had before this I pretty much like exclusively drink like iced coffee drinks it has to be like an Arctic tundra to to justify like a hot coffee for me it could be like you know Christmas even and raining and I'll be like gotta get an iced coffee I'll be wearing like an overcoat and like shivering and just my like iced americano what's that and I get to chew the ice it's a bonus but I think I think mainly my relationship with coffee is just how much caffeine I can have in my body for the duration of the day to offset whatever small amount of sleep I got that night so this is my phone and I keep my phone in the a folio case like a wallet case I do that because I up until like earlier this year I was like a three pocket person which I think a lot of guys are or I'd have my phone in one pocket my keys in the other pocket and my wallet the other pocket I just got kind of like exhausted of that and having bulgy pockets and one of the things I did was I installed nest locks on my house which are like little code locks gonna lock with your phone so I got rid of my house key I got a car and this is the key to my car and then I got rid of my wallet and just put my my money's in here this is all I all I travel with part of the reason for that is that when I tour I would leave my car keys at home anyway because I'd be away from my car in my house for you know five weeks at a time and so I would get back to LA and I would have to like reincorporate like having my car keys on me at all times into my like like what I was remembering and I would like leave my keys everywhere so I just condensed it to like this all the time and it's purple because I thought I was ordering a black one and I ordered a purple one and I'm appropriating um single mothers over 40 culture that's what I'm doing with this purple case this is a trimmer from a website called manscaped it uh it's for your balls it doesn't it doesn't chop your balls when you use it it's pretty great yeah I keep my ball trimmer in my face trimmer separate trimmers just out of respect for both areas you know I have a face trimmer also that has like a nose hair trimmer attachment that's pretty exciting to me I got really serious about trimming my nose hairs when one time my girlfriend and I were you know face to face as you often are with your loved one and she tucked one of my nose hairs back up into my nostril so I was like he time to really double down on this nose hair trimming because that's never gonna happen I guess shave the neckline you know it's really funny to me when some guys do like the chin the chin strap or they just shave all this stuff that's so horrible looking anybody in this room these are my favorite pair of headphones ever they're called a th m50x they're a pair of Audio Technica headphones and for me like basically up until I had these headphones like it's really hard to like mix music on headphones because a lot of like the music that I'm producing is very like sub heavy like it's a lot of like music that you feel in your chest it's really hard to replicate that with like really tiny speakers over your ears and these have just such a good bass response that like for all of blood harmony and a lot of when we all fall asleep where do we go this was like my primary source of like reference mixing headphones so these are like a huge deal to me this is the
GQ Videoseries,I'm the most excited about talking about this is my skincare regimen a couple months ago I had like just a the worst breakout I've ever had I've struggled with like acne since I was like 14 I've been to like 10 to 15 dermatologists over the course of that eight years it was a really punishing a demoralizing experience and at 22 I suddenly had like the worst breakout of my life while we were on tour Billy's album was coming out my skin was just like exploding this was my face like a couple months ago it's pretty unpleasant there's not so many pimples anymore and the reason that is is because of all this stuff it's it's his woman named Biba who has a company and she's a facialist and I go get facials from her and then her line is so great I use this acne wash every day and then this toner and then I use this medicine serum it's like a vitamin C based serum there's like a sunscreen that I use also sunscreen and moisturizer like a big deal and then every night I'll use this cleanser and then this toner and then I'll use this acne gel and it changed my life this is a guitar that I got while we were on tour this past summer I was in Boston and a day off I was like ooh I really want to go get a good tomorrow and I'm in a really fortunate position where I have a relationship with Fender or they make guitars for me and send them to me so I very rarely have to actually go buy a guitar anymore she's really awesome but that one day I was like oh I want to go get a guitar today I bought one in a while and the last time I bought a guitar was when I was like pretty flat broke and my teens I couldn't afford a nice guitar at all the only place that was open at like 7:30 p.m. was at Guitar Center that was like across the street from Berklee College of Music so I walked in and every kid in there is like a Berkley undergrad that was just like look I just shredding on their guitars and it was very intimidating to me because I can play a really sick open G chord that's my knowledge of guitar and I walked around the store and I found this disney/pixar cordova sponsored guitar basically made of balsa wood it's made of the same stuff that like a paper airplane that's made out of it's incredibly light it's super small and the guy selling it to me gave me a look like this that was the look that he gave me as he sold me this guitar and as I was leaving I was like oh I'd love to buy a case for it you guys have a case for that guitar and he was like no it plays beautifully and then I had it with me every day for the rest of the tour and I wrote I don't miss you at all on this guitar and I wrote partners in crime on this guitar and it's small enough that it's not in anyone's way if I'm sitting like on a bench seat in a tour bus next to people a lot of time you are and if I was like Lil Hank Williams the guitar that's like six times bigger than my body wouldn't work this is like the only like bigger essential I have and this is a a pelican that I got outfitted that I take everywhere that has all my recording gear I'll show you guys what I mean this is an Apollo Aero that's what I use to plug my mics in is my Norman TLM 103 screws on like that there's the cable goes from here here this is my version of a makeup tutorial now that might have seemed like a lot of work to demonstrate something but in terms of like actually recording a song that's pretty fast and then I'll hold it like this I'll wear those headphones I was just bragging about and this is how I recorded like everything on my EP it's how Billy and I just recorded her new song it's it's pretty great I'm a big fan of like holding this in your hands because like when you're standing in a mic stand for some reason like you plant your feet you get in a good location and you're kind of like this far away from it the whole time whether you're seeing really loud you're singing really quiet and I like it being handheld because I think just you're kind of like motion response to it means that when you're singing really quietly you'll hold it really close to your face like this when you start shouting you automatically kind of hold it further away and I think it just kind of is like the dynamics of it are much much tighter automatically through that so this has been my like refined way of recording in every hotel room I'm a big fan so I wanted to save the only real essential that I actually brought today like the only
GQ Videoseries,that truly is like essential to my life for for laughs but it's definitely the first one that I thought of and is this Claudia this is my girlfriend thanks so much for being here I was like hey would you come be my like my essential and the 10 essentials
GQ Videoseries,and I think she didn't understand that I wanted her to like she's the most important part of my life easily and I think at first she thought I was just like would you come watch me film my 10 essentials videos she would watch a lot of things that she do I was like yeah I if you feel that I really should be there I can come and support you last
GQ Videoseries,I want to do is like objectify my girlfriend she's her own person and I think much more valuable than me or than my iced coffee or my beep of beauty supply products but the feeling is mutual yeah if I became a man and filmed 10 essentials you would also be in my 10 essentials Klein I've been dating for like a little over a year and one of the things that we get to do a lot like to her a lot is get to travel together a lot if I'm on a flight without her I go through like several movies and like I don't know like all this nonsense and I'm uncomfortable the whole time and I'm just waiting to get like Wi-Fi so I could text her again and if Claudia is on the flight with me then we just like make each other laugh for like five or six hours we're a very low stress couple it's pretty awesome you know yeah you're the best we've really locked down traveling we make the most of every delay I would categorize travel as like a stressful experience and with you I've never stressed and by yeah it's pretty good we're already where we want to be a car that's perfect I know we're the worst up once again my name is Phineas thank you guys so much for watching my ten essentials [Laughter]
GQ Videoseries,I keep this in the stash you know man like remember we're all Beyonce says she keep the house also huh yeah I'm oh yeah I'm rocking with you Beyonce I'm gonna aim type of tone in my back pocket pull it up what up G Q this is young inmate and these are my essentials all right one of the first items definitely a white tee when I can't function without no fresh whitey all that designer stuff is cool sigh to have you know that just be firing them and dead but I'm gonna take person when I wake up I could throw in a white tea for the day and be cool I can't wear no dingy white tee and I mean somebody sees me while show them they still got the underarm stings under maybe the old Cooley staying somewhere or a Hennessy stain always a fresh pack I mean always got to get a fresh pack of white tees you know if I can count how many turns up with a pack o eighties or halfway T's oh and I could got my dollar for each one definitely be a millionaire it's just part of me man fresh team and it's like winning drugs my favourite chicken I could take when I'm going to throw some time to me and got him they got every other brand every other arts every other flavor and I think everybody like these are some because nine times out of ten I'm barely father so when I do get out of it like at least two guys the chips taste like a like chicken strip everything in one like just nice and seasoned like me you hungry you need these trip these chips you are like saddest father and a lot of people don't know neither the technique to these because when you get them you don't just get them and open them up and you got to turn upside down if it's only season in the spicy stuff is in the bottom  okay let's see if we got a good we got a couple good ones there now I mean they gotta be looking like this and they gotta be seasoned see it's like one or two in hair that's part in that to season like this one this one is a little chilly compared to this one but yeah he's my favorite I can't eat it right now for that come on grizzle I can't beat you once though because they've got 300 minutes of sodium minute so I try not to do it too much but whenever I get the taste for me is like my go-to and roll grab bag of chips speaking of grills this is definitely one
GQ Videoseries,I can't I can't go outside without like I don't my dad's just cool I mean nice or tomorrow buzz down pretty much I can leave this at home my chain beautiful this is my logo on medallion my trophy loved it beautiful but I can leave this at home these right here I can't leave these hand over there like no matter like if I leave the house and I don't have my grills like I literally spin the block and go back to get my girls before that's like the worst
GQ Videoseries,for me is to not have my girls my mom go out publicly I just feel like this part of me is my signature I had grilled since like 2013 I was like six years ago I got my first pair of girls and I'll have bottoms actually at first all this for gold bottoms that's all I had that's how I started and then eventually as time came on I wanted more so I got six and then six turned into tops top was turned into diamonds and then diamonds turned into eight now eight tops ain't bottoms fully bunched up and that's today my favorite my favorite jury I can't live without I got 4 pair right now I got two two pairs of gold ones that I had for a minute now that got like actually diamonds in them as well and then I got to floodwaters two-parent flutterwings both eight bottles eight tops how many pairs are lost man I don't lost it good mmm Oh ten pair groups so like you do the math man it's a lot of money involved definitely learned my lesson my issue was putting the girls when I first got it was putting the girls into a napkin when I take them out I put it up put in my pocket forget about it what's this in my pocket garbage throw it out let me see one yet so I definitely learnt that lesson I never put my grills in the tissue that's one
GQ Videoseries,that anybody need to know if you got grills don't never put your girls on the tissue you will always end up throwing it up that girl dealer cologne man can't go nowhere without smelling good petty for example a lot of people know me in the video I pulled the deed or out in my back pocket and I said I'll deal with Mike alone she said my sin is her obsession but yet it survives smells great the ladies love it real clean real pure and it sticks and I can't I can't leave the house without it I got a smoker that I actually bring it with me most of the time like I will bring my own type of people out for a high flame awesome I smell good is fading I have to spray these three more sprays real quick it's like a little traditional
GQ Videoseries,like a dish the Cologne des [Laughter] it's like my pimp cut man a lot of people know too because was a train that
GQ Videoseries,back in like the early 2000s and to me is like it's like one of my most lively things I mean I drink out of a regular cup but like for some reason it tastes different than this cup and as you can see I got my logo on it let's go change and this is like a brand new as well as like just a cup to have whatever you want anything no he's got to be anything I want water juice but at the same time it's like when I bring it places it's like my little my little trophy it's like I'm showing off the brand at the same time and then I can have my little sit whenever I feel like it and I like that is black black I feel like there's a don't color rag kind of makes you look like a party and flag black is a little more classy little more cool I got this cup from from Barney's and I just slapped my logo I was like oh I can't I feel like I said like I'm addicted to spicy food I love spice if it ain't hot it ain't right and I gotta be spicy like I don't like the mouth hot sauce I need it hot and I eat it for fun pause in a good way I'll put a hot sauce on of course chicken seafood my shrimp my fish my odors and noodles I put on everything then there are fruit I don't pass those on fruit my collard greens anything that I feel like deserves hot sauce is household and that's me my headphones man I need my headphones because like first of all I like the block a lot of things out I like to be in my own zone definite when it come to music so my headphones is like a go-to
GQ Videoseries,I can't get on the plane without headphones I can't move Airport without headphones sometimes when I'm sitting in the car and I don't want to hear what's on the radio or something on a Surrey I'll put my headphones on I'll need my headphones at all time definitely young and me she's one of my favorite artists it's always got her a plan and then and I listen to a lot of old school stuff in the headphones I like soul music R&B music for some reason it sets the tone we listen to it in the headphones in life makes you feel like you got a space real quick rap is cool I like to play rap throw out laughs awesome speakers and stuff like that I listen to beats a lot of times are comes on I'm more when I listen to beats on my headphones Oh more so than hearing a loud kind of noise me here every part of the instrument and then the beat sometimes I write with nobody I cappella I just probably have something on my mind and I'll write but majority out of time I do listen to it be first just to get a sense of where I'm gonna go with the lyrics and yeah my hat messed up but on yes my New York Yankee everybody know you made for win it this is like my go-to hat I have so many hats I probably got like probably hello over thousand everybody if you know that you see me that mostly it's like my signature had a flag it's a Brooklyn
GQ Videoseries,to you know Brooklyn was always known for that that low flame you know jay-z he set the tone with that and it's like my go-to hat I wear this I grab this I can wear this with anything that's lay the blue one since today I got on the rarity but I usually arrived and they review that's the traditional going gang keys I saw them two type of person I don't really uh carry cash I'm a colored person you know me and I got healthy cars chunky parts you know man he ain't just your average cards and I'm not really I don't really like to carry a lot of cash I'm not one of those rappers that walk around with a bunch of racks on every now and then if I know I'm about to go out and shop I'll probably have a significant amount of cash but most of the time like I just carry my cars when we play like a good $200 the most of our pocket but I'm just one of them I'm just not that type of person I just feel like that's a walking target they have a bunch of money in your pocket I just number them I start my car another situation anything happened call it up fix's send me another one easygoing you know once you lose money you lose one snow getting that back so you definitely can't go no way around my car swipe swipe yo what up G Q this is young MA thank you for checking out my essentials
GQ Videoseries,maybe we should have saved a peanut butter for last I don't know what I'm doing hey GQ I'm Adam Devine and these are my essentials  I always like to have a hat nearby in case I wake up and my hair's looking foul these are like in no exact order but I usually like to have a hat that means something to me these are my Clippers what's up qui welcome to LA you know Nebraska that's where I'm from this hat was given to me by future President Joe Biden am i casting a vote already no we'll see we'll see how he does in the primaries and he gave it to me when I visited the White House and he was super cool to me and this hat I feel like every guy has I have a hat that they workout in and this was from the movie I did game over man Brand X stunts which are the cool stunt team and I like to I like to get all sweaty in it the hair girls over there just going to I'm a rebel now I don't know about you guys but I have to have shoes and my favorite type of shoes are vans they're mad comfy and I like to feel like I might do a kickflip I've never done one but I like to feel like if a skateboarder is available I might attempt it I wore these shoes on my stand-up special streaming now live on Netflix Adam Devine's best time of our lives these shoes were gifted to me recently and I haven't worn them yet but I have like like probably like 50 pairs of hands and I I like to wear plus they're cheap baby save a dollar  protein is important let's admit that okay if you want to keep your chassis tight and you want to build the perfect meat mountain you have to protein load and that's why I like peanut butter a lot of people are like oh that's too fatty if you eat too much that you get fat you'd be the judge not me I don't like to lie in iron what they put in that peanut butter I don't like to iron every time I have iron to anything it ends up being more wrinkled so that's why I like Downey's wrinkle release and this stuff's incredible you just on your clothes give a little shrink shrink shrink shrink and it is D wrinkled so pick up some of this I travel a lot and I always keep this in my bag you gotta have your toiletries gang this is my toiletry bag it's pretty cool it has my initials in there I'll never tell you what P stands for Patrick I did I keep a ton of stuff in here there's myrrh and shaved stuff a lot of people are like whoa dude you're 35 years old how do you look so boyish the answer is I'm wish your eyes you have to or else you just look like a old handbag or something and then I you know you got to stay deodorize I keep a comb to keep the locks and all the right places this is a this is sunscreen I feel like that's important to you don't to have those weird age spots when you're an old person and there's just like a dark spot right here that's turning purple and then I also have a little wrinkle release to go bottle because I'm never far from a wrinkled shirt and these are my tour trees gang you guys are these I bet you do keeps everything nice and tidy I was gifted this book the creative block sometimes when I'm writing I am just sitting at my desk and the ideas aren't flowing it's actually really cool you open it up and there's a bunch of just writing exercises or just something to to get the creative juices snail in hey your neighbor get their story so then you weirdly are talking to our neighbors and like in Hollywood like people don't talk to each other so like Oh what was this weirdo talking to me I remember him from a Taco Bell commercial or something I've done a few of those it's actually really cool it helps me think of things that I normally wouldn't think to write about like spark words clean up your room it helps me think about like maybe household chores that I don't like to do and maybe I can write about that something that I normally wouldn't want to write about or think that that might be boring and then you find creative outlets to sort of explore create a blog I don't know about you guys but I like to keep clean drawers I always keep a clean batch in my travel bag that way if I'm ever on the road and I might forget underwear I always have at least three pairs Calvin Klein is probably my favorite underwear Mark Wahlberg has taught me that this is the sexiest pair of underwear to own it keeps all the the nuggets packed in nice and tight I carry this mostly for this photo because this is my Fitz bow right here I'm trying to look like underwear model number three as a tight package right there someday I would take off my pants and drop them to my knees and take off my shirt and flex for you guys but I've got a lot of shaking heads no over there so we'll keep them on for now I feel that a good watch is definitely an essential come on guys clasp up your game so I like love watches I always have one on whenever I'm not shooting something because as a person I like to be able to tell time I just love watches I think it's so cool that like the back of this one right here you could see all the inner workings on the back and I think that's pretty awesome all these little pieces working together I always try to pick up a watch what I want to remember something in my life and this watch right here was my first like nice watch that I bought five or six years ago now it's an Omega Speedmaster the Apollo I want to say the 30th anniversary or 35th anniversary it is a meteorite face which is pretty cool I was on the road doing stand-up and I found out that my house was broken into and they stole a bunch of my stuff kind of bummed about that and I wanted this watch forever and I walked past and Omega boutique and saw it in the in the window I swooped this baby up and I'm I'm glad I have it I don't have any Rolexes because I think they're like I mean I think they're super cool but it's also they're a little bougie I like Omega is a lot more they feel like more of like a workingman's nice watch unless Rolex wants to send me one in which case I'll take the Batman with the Jubilee bracelet thank you sometimes throughout the day I get a little sluggish so I like to have what I call my good good juice I'll crack open a sugar-free Red Bull and Alec Oi and mix them together over some ice and that'll jumpstart the rest of the day I feel like Red Bull is a little to gasoline II for me so I like to cut it with a little sparkling water am i a boozy bad boy you bet your ass when I was shooting workaholics maybe like two seasons and we were doing everything on the show right in it and acting in it and producing it and so the days were like 14 15 hour days I needed something to pick me up throughout the day and I didn't want to be a drug addict so I got taught this instead I would say successful pivot so I noticed like a bunch of guys when they do these videos they like we're cool guy leather jackets people want to hit me when I wear a leather jacket I've noticed like I have a very punchable face and I think when I wear a leather jacket they're like oh this guy thinks he's all tough I don't okay do not try to punch me I will fall and cry so I like a nice denim jacket I feel like Levi's specifically just fits me really nicely like sometimes you get like these really fashion-forward brands and you go to put on the denim jacket and you're like you can't move your arms I'm a beefy boy I like to say I'm a light guy living in an app guy world and this denim jacket fits these lats movie perfect I speak other languages I have my ear pods I love them not because I necessarily like love music I do love music I'm not a psychopath but I also like to put them in and be like I'm sorry I can't I am on the actually talk right now so that's why I like my air pod so much you guys know where to buy these this is an essential for me I travel all the time I'm all over the place - instantiation I'm doing so I like to have something that I could carry on and something that some super compact so I like this away suitcase that I have it's not pink it is orange I did something for the NBA Awards and they gave me this as a gift which is super cool and it is supposed to be a basketball it's in a way brand which I didn't know was like a brand for a while I thought it was like a play on like home team away team until my girlfriend's like no that's not like a very popular suitcase luggage brand you can charge your phone on it which TSA all they love that
