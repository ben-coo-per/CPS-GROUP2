Primary Recordings,"So this is called Kadiyam in Telugu and it is called bracelet in general language. This is made of copper and it can be made of silver and gold as well, depending upon how rich you are. So the significance of this item is that it is actually worn as to safeguard oneself from evil forces in the nature.

So my grandfather gets them to sign one piece of paper for my uncle and another one for my mum, but John Lennon's pen keeps failing and he refuses to sign the second paper after the failed attempt.

Reddit Thread,"My dad owns a Gibson F-4 I think mandolin made somewhere between 1906 and 1916 I can't remember where it is in there, it took a lot of research to find the date when we did. It was purchased by my Grandpa in the 50's for the steep price of 50 dollars to fool around on. It has a turtle shell pick guard as well as beautiful inlay on almost every piece of the instrument including the tuning keys. The value since then has increased immensely, but I don't think my dad or I will ever sell it. Besides the emotional attachment due to my grandfather buying it this is also a piece of history. It is one of the first instruments made by my favorite company, the people who crafted this mandolin almost 100 years ago paved the way for many of the great guitars of today which I have the honor of playing and owning.

Reddit Thread,"I wear my Grandpa's service tags 24/7. I haven't taken them off since his funeral. I worry all the time that they'll be broken. I worry even more that someone will take them off if I land myself in the ER or something but not having his dog tags won't change anything. I still have the memories, and I guess the greatest loss for me would be forgetting all of that. Even if I'm not aware of the loss I have undergone. I'm sorry that I'm long winded, but I guess this was kind of cathartic. If you're curious about the service tags, my grandpa was in the Army. I lives with him from 4 to 17 years old. He passed away a few weeks before I turned 20. When I was 16, I wanted to wear the tags to school because we were talking about WWII in history (I thought my teacher would like seeing them). I asked him if he still had them, and he showed me them in his nightstand. I was kind of in awe, and I asked if I could wear them. My grandpa is not sentimental at all. He answered me by saying, ""You like them? You can keep them."" It was all very casual, but I wore them frequently up until his death. Travelling to his funeral, I wore them, but I took them off before the wake. I didn't put them back on until I returned to my hotel room after all the services were done, and I haven't taken them off since. I partially didn't wear them during the services because I didn't want one of my aunts to suddenly decide they wanted them and try to guilt me and intimidate me into giving them up. My aunts never did understand that I considered him my dad (my mom understood). I'd put up a picture, but they obviously have his identifying information on them. They're standard issue. I'm not sure if they're originals or not. They have the little indent toward the top left (when reading the tag), and on the back there is a rim. The lettering is stamped with two lines of writing. The top line is last name, first name. And the second line is his military ID (not SSN). I tested him once to see if he could remember his number because of something on NCIS (which my grandpa happened to love). The tags are in fairly good shape. There are a few dents and scratches. I wish now that I had asked for more stories about when he was in the military. Off the top of my head, the only story I can recall was when he was a private and the most disliked private was giving the duty of waking everyone up. Which just made everyone dislike him even more to the point people were constantly pulling pranks on him. Anyways, I should wrap this up... I just have a lot of fond memories of my grandpa because he was an amazing man.",,24,42,2,7,12,2,11
